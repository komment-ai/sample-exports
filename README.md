# Sample Exports - Komment

This repository contains a few Komment wikis exported as markdown output.

Users can have this output directly pushed to their own code repositories as part of a Komment pipeline. This enables developers to always have their docs reside alongside their code.

These structured exported outputs can be leveraged to build downstream applications, automate processes, and gain valuable insights from the data and insights extracted by Komment from a codebase.
