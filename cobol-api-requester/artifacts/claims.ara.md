## Description

The `claims.ara` file is a binary archive file that contains compiled COBOL programs and other resources for the CICS Claims Service application. It is used to package and deploy the application's components, including COBOL programs, copybooks, and other dependencies.


## Implementation details

The `claims.ara` file is generated by the CICS Application Archive Tool and contains a collection of compiled COBOL programs and other resources that are used by the CICS Claims Service application. The file is used to deploy the application's components to a CICS region, where they can be executed by the CICS runtime environment.

The `claims.ara` file contains the following components:

* Compiled COBOL programs, including `claimci0.cbl` and `imsclaim.cbl`
* COBOL copybooks, including `claiminf.cpy` and `imsclaic.cpy`
* Other dependencies, such as data definitions and resource definitions

The `claims.ara` file is used in conjunction with the `CICSClaimsService.sar` file, which contains the CICS application's configuration and deployment information.
