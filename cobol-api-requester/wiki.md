# CICS Application Wiki
=====================================

## Introduction
---------------

Welcome to the CICS Application Wiki, your comprehensive resource for understanding and working with the CICS Claims API and Service. This repository provides a robust and scalable solution for claims processing, leveraging the power of CICS (Customer Information Control System) to deliver efficient and reliable transactions. Dive into our documentation to explore the features, architecture, and usage of this powerful application.

## Description
-------------

This repository contains the CICS Claims API and Service, designed to facilitate claims processing for various industries. The application provides a standardized interface for submitting, processing, and retrieving claims data, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. The repository includes:

* CICS Claims API: A RESTful API for interacting with the claims service
* CICS Claims Service: A CICS-based service for processing claims data
* COBOL programs: Custom-built COBOL programs for claims processing and data manipulation
* Configuration files: XML and JSON files for configuring the application
* JCL files: Job Control Language files for compiling and executing COBOL programs

## Architecture
-------------

The CICS Application architecture consists of the following core components:

* **CICS Claims API**: Handles incoming requests and sends responses to clients
* **CICS Claims Service**: Processes claims data and interacts with the COBOL programs
* **COBOL Programs**: Perform claims processing, data validation, and data manipulation
* **Configuration Files**: Store application settings and configuration data
* **JCL Files**: Control the compilation and execution of COBOL programs

These components interact as follows:

* Clients send requests to the CICS Claims API
* The API invokes the CICS Claims Service to process the request
* The service interacts with the COBOL programs to perform claims processing
* The COBOL programs access configuration files for application settings
* JCL files control the compilation and execution of COBOL programs

## Usage
-----

### Installation

To install the CICS Application, follow these steps:

* Download the repository artifacts (CICSClaimsAPIProject.zip, CICSClaimsServiceProject.zip, etc.)
* Extract the contents to a designated directory
* Compile the COBOL programs using the provided JCL files
* Configure the application using the configuration files (server.xml, claims.properties, etc.)
* Deploy the CICS Claims API and Service to your CICS environment

### Configuration

Configure the application by modifying the configuration files:

* server.xml: Configure the CICS Claims API and Service settings
* claims.properties: Define claims processing settings and rules
* claims.json: Store claims data and configuration

### Running the Application

To run the CICS Application, follow these steps:

* Start the CICS environment
* Execute the CICS Claims API and Service
* Send requests to the API to process claims data
* Monitor the application logs for errors and debugging information
