## Description

The `claimreq.cpy` file is a COBOL copybook that defines the structure of a request message for a claims application. It is generated from a JSON schema file `getClaimRule_request.json` using the `DFHJS2LS` tool. The copybook contains the definition of the `ReqQueryParameters` record, which includes fields for `claimType` and `claimAmount`.


## Usage instructions


**Step 1: Include the copybook in your COBOL program**

To use the `claimreq.cpy` file, you need to include it in your COBOL program using the `COPY` statement.

**Step 2: Define the `ReqQueryParameters` record**

 Define the `ReqQueryParameters` record in your COBOL program using the `06` level number.

**Step 3: Populate the `claimType` and `claimAmount` fields**

Populate the `claimType` and `claimAmount` fields with the required data. Note that `claimType` is a varying length field with a maximum length of 255 characters, and `claimAmount` is a floating point number.

**Step 4: Use the `ReqQueryParameters` record in your program logic**

Use the `ReqQueryParameters` record in your program logic to process the claims request.


## Implementation details


The `claimreq.cpy` file defines the following records and fields:

* `ReqQueryParameters`: a record that contains the `claimType` and `claimAmount` fields.
* `claimType`: a varying length field with a maximum length of 255 characters.
* `claimAmount`: a floating point number.

The copybook uses the `PIC` clause to define the format of the fields, and the `COMP-5` and `COMP-2` clauses to specify the data type of the fields.

Note that the `claimreq.cpy` file is generated from a JSON schema file, and the structure of the record and fields may change if the JSON schema changes.
