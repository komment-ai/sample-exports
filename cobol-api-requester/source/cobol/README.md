## Description

The `./source/cobol/` directory contains COBOL source files and copybooks for the CICS application. The files in this directory are used to define the business logic and data structures for the claims processing system.


## Contents

The directory contains the following files:

* `claiminf.cpy`, `imsclaic.cpy`, `claimreq.cpy`, `claimrqc.cpy`, `claimrsp.cpy`, `claimrsc.cpy`: COBOL copybooks that define data structures and constants used throughout the application.
* `claimci0.cbl`, `imsclaim.cbl`: COBOL source files that contain the business logic for claims processing.


## Purpose

The COBOL source files in this directory are used to implement the claims processing functionality of the CICS application. They interact with other components of the application, such as the IMS database and the CICS server, to retrieve and update claims data.


## Relationship to Other Components

The COBOL source files in this directory are compiled and linked with other components of the application, such as the JCL files in the `./source/jcl/` directory, to create the executable code for the CICS application.
