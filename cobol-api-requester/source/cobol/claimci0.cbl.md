## Description
The `claimci0.cbl` file is a COBOL program that provides a CICS (Customer Information Control System) interface for managing health insurance claims. It allows users to submit, read, and update claim records stored in a VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) data set. The program uses z/OS Connect to call a REST API to evaluate claims based on business rules.

## Usage instructions

**Step 1: Compile and Link the Program**

Compile the `claimci0.cbl` program using a COBOL compiler, and link it with the necessary libraries to create an executable file.

**Step 2: Define the VSAM Data Set**

Define a VSAM KSDS data set to store the claim records. The data set should have a key field for the claim ID and a record format that matches the structure of the claim record.

**Step 3: Configure z/OS Connect**

Configure z/OS Connect to call the REST API that evaluates claims based on business rules. This involves defining the API endpoint, authentication credentials, and any other necessary parameters.

**Step 4: Start the CICS Region**

Start the CICS region and ensure that it is configured to use the `claimci0` program as a transaction.

**Step 5: Test the Program**

Test the program by submitting, reading, and updating claim records using the CICS interface. Verify that the program correctly evaluates claims based on business rules and updates the claim records accordingly.

## Implementation details

The program uses the following functions and sections:

* `DO-MAIN-CONTROL`: The main control section of the program, which initializes variables, obtains the channel name, and browses the channel for containers.
* `DO-INITIALIZATION`: The initialization section, which initializes local variables and sets pointers to the request and response segments.
* `DO-SUBMIT-CLAIM-REC`: The section that submits a claim record, which writes the record to the VSAM data set and calls the REST API to evaluate the claim.
* `DO-READ-CLAIM-REC`: The section that reads a claim record, which reads the record from the VSAM data set based on the claim ID.
* `DO-UPDATE-CLAIM-REC`: The section that updates a claim record, which reads the record from the VSAM data set, updates the record, and writes it back to the data set.
* `DO-CALL-CLAIM-RULE`: The section that calls the REST API to evaluate a claim based on business rules.
* `DO-WRITE-TO-CSMT`: The section that writes additional information to the CSMT TD queue.

The program uses the following variables and parameters:

* `WS-CHANNEL-NAME`: The name of the channel used to receive requests and send responses.
* `WS-CONTAINER-NAME`: The name of the container used to store the request and response data.
* `WS-INPUT-LENGTH`: The length of the input data received from the channel.
* `WS-FILE-NAME`: The name of the VSAM data set used to store the claim records.
* `REQ-CLAIM-ID`: The claim ID specified in the request.
* `REQ-CLAIM-TYPE`: The claim type specified in the request.
* `REQ-CLAIM-AMOUNT`: The claim amount specified in the request.
