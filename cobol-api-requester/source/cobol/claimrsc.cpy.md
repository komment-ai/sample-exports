## Description
The `claimrsc.cpy` file is a COBOL copybook that defines the structure of a response container for a claims application. It is used to format the data returned by the application, including claim details and CICS response codes.

## Usage instructions

**Step 1: Include the copybook in your COBOL program**

To use the `claimrsc.cpy` copybook, you need to include it in your COBOL program using the `COPY` statement. For example:
```
COPY claimrsc.
```
**Step 2: Define the response container**

You need to define a variable that conforms to the `RSP-CLAIM-CONTAINER` structure defined in the copybook. For example:
```
01  CLAIM-RESPONSE.
    03  CLAIM-RECORD.
       05  CLAIM-ID             PIC X(8).
       05  CLAIM-DETAILS.
          10  CLAIM-TYPE        PIC X(8).
          10  CLAIM-AMOUNT      COMP-2 SYNC.
          10  CLAIM-DATE        PIC X(10).
          10  CLAIM-DESC        PIC X(21).
          10  CLAIM-PROVIDER    PIC X(21).
          10  CLAIM-STATUS      PIC X(4).
       03  CLAIM-CICS-RESP       PIC S9(8) COMP.
       03  CLAIM-CICS-RESP2      PIC S9(8) COMP.
       03  CLAIM-OUTPUT-MESSAGE  PIC X(80).
```
**Step 3: Populate the response container**

You need to populate the `CLAIM-RESPONSE` variable with data returned by the claims application. This may involve moving data from other variables or structures into the corresponding fields of the `CLAIM-RESPONSE` structure.

## Implementation details

The `claimrsc.cpy` copybook defines a single structure, `RSP-CLAIM-CONTAINER`, which contains several fields:

* `RSP-CLAIM-RECORD`: a record that contains claim details, including `CLAIM-ID`, `CLAIM-TYPE`, `CLAIM-AMOUNT`, `CLAIM-DATE`, `CLAIM-DESC`, `CLAIM-PROVIDER`, and `CLAIM-STATUS`.
* `RSP-CLAIM-CICS-RESP`: a CICS response code.
* `RSP-CLAIM-CICS-RESP2`: a second CICS response code.
* `RSP-CLAIM-OUTPUT-MESSAGE`: a message returned by the claims application.

Note that the copybook does not contain any executable code, but rather defines a data structure that can be used by COBOL programs to format and return data.
