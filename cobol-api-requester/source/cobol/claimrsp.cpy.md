## Description

The `claimrsp.cpy` file is a COBOL copybook that defines the structure for a response JSON schema in a CICS application. It contains the generated language structure for the `getClaimRule_200_response.json` schema, which was created using the `DFHJS2LS` tool at mapping level `4.3`. The copybook defines a response body with optional fields for claim type, amount, status, and reason.


## Usage instructions


**Step 1: Include the copybook in your COBOL program**

To use the `claimrsp.cpy` copybook, include it in your COBOL program using the `COPY` statement. For example:
```
COPY claimrsp.
```
**Step 2: Define the response body**

 Define the response body in your COBOL program using the `RespBody` structure defined in the copybook. For example:
```
 RespBody.
   claim-type-num
   claim-type
   amount-num
   amount
   Xstatus-num
   Xstatus
   reason-num
   reason
```
**Step 3: Populate the response body**

Populate the response body with data using the defined fields. For example:
```
 MOVE 1 TO claim-type-num
 MOVE 'claim-type-value' TO claim-type
```
**Step 4: Use the response body**

Use the response body in your COBOL program as needed. For example, you can use it to return a response to a web service request.


## Implementation details


The `claimrsp.cpy` copybook defines the following fields:

* `claim-type-num`: a counter for the number of claim types
* `claim-type`: a string field for the claim type value
* `amount-num`: a counter for the number of amounts
* `amount`: a string field for the amount value
* `Xstatus-num`: a counter for the number of statuses
* `Xstatus`: a string field for the status value
* `reason-num`: a counter for the number of reasons
* `reason`: a string field for the reason value

The copybook uses the `PIC` clause to define the format of each field, and the `SYNC` clause to ensure that the fields are properly aligned.
