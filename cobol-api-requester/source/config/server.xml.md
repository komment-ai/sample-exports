## Description

The `server.xml` file is a configuration file for the z/OS Connect EE server, which is part of the CICS application. It defines the server's settings, features, and behavior, including security, API and service configurations, and connection settings.


## Usage instructions


**Step 1: Review and update the server settings**

Review the server settings in the `server.xml` file, including the host and port numbers, to ensure they match your environment. Update the settings as necessary.

**Step 2: Configure security settings**

Configure the security settings, including SSL/TLS protocols, ciphers, and key stores, to ensure secure communication with the server.

**Step 3: Define API and service configurations**

Define the API and service configurations, including the `zosconnect_zosConnectAPIs` and `zosconnect_services` elements, to specify the APIs and services exposed by the server.

**Step 4: Configure connection settings**

Configure the connection settings, including the `zosconnect_endpointConnection` and `zosconnect_cicsIpicConnection` elements, to specify the connections to external systems.

**Step 5: Review and update the logging settings**

Review and update the logging settings, including the `safRegistry` and `safAuthorization` elements, to ensure that logging is configured correctly.


## Implementation details


The `server.xml` file is an XML file that defines the configuration for the z/OS Connect EE server. It includes the following key elements:

* `featureManager`: specifies the features enabled on the server
* `httpEndpoint`: specifies the host and port numbers for the server
* `ssl`: specifies the SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers used by the server
* `zosconnect_zosConnectAPIs` and `zosconnect_services`: specify the APIs and services exposed by the server
* `zosconnect_endpointConnection` and `zosconnect_cicsIpicConnection`: specify the connections to external systems
* `safRegistry` and `safAuthorization`: specify the logging settings for the server

The file uses a combination of XML elements and attributes to define the server's configuration. The elements and attributes are specific to the z/OS Connect EE server and are used to configure the server's behavior.
