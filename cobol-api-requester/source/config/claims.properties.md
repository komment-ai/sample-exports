## Description


The `claims.properties` file is a configuration file used in the CICS application project. It contains key-value pairs that define various settings and parameters for the application. These settings include file locations, prefixes, connection references, and logging directories.


## Usage instructions


**Step 1: Review Configuration Options**

Review the configuration options in the `claims.properties` file to ensure they align with your application's requirements. Note the following parameters:

* `apiDescriptionFile`: the location of the API description file
* `dataStructuresLocation`: the location of the data structures
* `apiInfoFileLocation`: the location of the API info file
* `requesterPrefix`: the prefix for requester IDs
* `connectionRef`: the reference to the connection node
* `logFileDirectory`: the directory for log files
* `language`: the programming language used (in this case, COBOL)

**Step 2: Update Configuration Options (if necessary)**

Update the configuration options in the `claims.properties` file if necessary. Ensure that the file locations and prefixes are correct for your application.

**Step 3: Use the Configuration File in the Application**

Use the `claims.properties` file in the CICS application by referencing it in the application code. The application will read the configuration options from this file and use them to configure its behavior.


## Implementation details


The `claims.properties` file is a simple text file with key-value pairs. The file is read by the CICS application, and the configuration options are used to configure the application's behavior. There are no complex functions or classes in this file, as it is simply a configuration file.
