## Description
The `./source/config/claims.json` file is a configuration file that defines the API endpoints and data models for a claims processing system. It is written in JSON format and follows the OpenAPI (Swagger) 2.0 specification. The file provides a description of the API, including the available endpoints, request and response parameters, and data models.

## Usage instructions

**Step 1: Review the API Endpoints**

Review the `paths` section of the file to understand the available API endpoints. In this case, there is only one endpoint, `/claim/rule`, which supports a GET request.

**Step 2: Understand the Request Parameters**

Review the `parameters` section of the file to understand the required request parameters. In this case, the `claimType` and `claimAmount` parameters are required.

**Step 3: Understand the Response Model**

Review the `definitions` section of the file to understand the response model. In this case, the response will be an object with four properties: `claim-type`, `amount`, `status`, and `reason`.

**Step 4: Implement the API Client**

Use the information in this file to implement an API client that can interact with the claims processing system. The client should be able to send a GET request to the `/claim/rule` endpoint with the required request parameters and parse the response model.

## Implementation details

The file defines a single API endpoint, `/claim/rule`, which supports a GET request. The endpoint takes two required request parameters, `claimType` and `claimAmount`, and returns a response model with four properties: `claim-type`, `amount`, `status`, and `reason`.

The response model is defined in the `definitions` section of the file. The model has four properties:

* `claim-type`: a string representing the type of claim
* `amount`: a string representing the amount of the claim
* `status`: a string representing the status of the claim
* `reason`: a string representing the reason for the claim status

The file does not define any non-trivial named functions, methods, or classes.
