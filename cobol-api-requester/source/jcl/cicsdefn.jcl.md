## Description
The `cicsdefn.jcl` file is a JCL (Job Control Language) script used to define CICS (Customer Information Control System) resources for a sample CICS program. It is part of a larger CICS application project and is responsible for setting up the necessary resources for the program to run.

## Usage instructions

**Step 1: Update the JCL script with the correct data set names**

The JCL script contains placeholders for the CICS data set names, which need to be updated with the actual names used in the project. Specifically, the `<CICSPRFX>`, `<CICSAOR1>`, and `<CICS.VSAM.FILE>` placeholders need to be replaced with the corresponding data set names.

**Step 2: Customize the resource definitions**

The JCL script defines several resources, including a program, a group, and a file. The definitions can be customized to fit the specific needs of the project. For example, the `Description` field can be updated to provide a more detailed description of the program.

**Step 3: Submit the JCL script to the mainframe**

Once the JCL script has been updated and customized, it can be submitted to the mainframe for execution. This will create the necessary CICS resources for the program to run.

## Implementation details

The JCL script uses the `DFHCSDUP` program to define the CICS resources. The script consists of several sections, each defining a different resource:

* `ADD GROUP(DEMOGRP) LIST(DEMOLIST)`: Defines a new group called `DEMOGRP` and adds it to the `DEMOLIST` list.
* `Define Program(CLAIMCI0) Group(DEMOGRP)`: Defines a new program called `CLAIMCI0` and assigns it to the `DEMOGRP` group.
* `Define File(CLAIMCIF) Group(DEMOGRP)`: Defines a new file called `CLAIMCIF` and assigns it to the `DEMOGRP` group.

The script also specifies various attributes for each resource, such as the description, language, and data location.
