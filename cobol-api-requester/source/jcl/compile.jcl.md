## Description

The `compile.jcl` file is a Job Control Language (JCL) script used to compile and link-edit a CICS COBOL program. It is part of a larger CICS application project that utilizes z/OS Connect. The script provides a set of instructions for the mainframe to compile the COBOL source code, link-edit the resulting object code, and create a load module.


## Usage instructions


**Step 1: Update the JCL script with dataset names**

Update the JCL script with the correct dataset names for the COBOL compiler, CICS, LE, and z/OS Connect data sets.

**Step 2: Specify the source and copybook libraries**

Specify the PDS data sets containing the COBOL source code and copybooks used by the program.

**Step 3: Define the load library**

Define the PDSE library where the load module will be stored.

**Step 4: Customize the JCL script for your environment**

Customize the JCL script to match your specific mainframe environment, including updating the job card, STEPLIB, SYSLIB, and other parameters as needed.

**Step 5: Submit the JCL script to the mainframe**

Submit the JCL script to the mainframe for execution, which will compile and link-edit the COBOL program.

**Step 6: Verify the results**

Verify that the load module has been created successfully and is ready for use in the CICS application.


## Implementation details


The JCL script consists of three main sections:

*   `CBLPROC`: This section invokes the COBOL compiler and link-editor to compile the COBOL source code and create a load module.
*   `COPYLINK`: This section reblocks the DFHEILID dataset for use by the link-edit step.
*   `LKED`: This section invokes the MVS linkage-editor program to link-edit the object code and create the load module.

The script uses various parameters and configuration options, including:

*   `LNGPRFX`: The high-level qualifier for the COBOL compiler data set.
*   `CICSPRFX`: The high-level qualifier for the CICS data sets.
*   `LIBPRFX`: The high-level qualifier for the LE data sets.
*   `COPYBOOK.PDS.LIB`: The name of the PDS data set containing the copybooks used by the program.
*   `SOURCE.PDS.LIB`: The name of the PDS data set containing the COBOL source code.
*   `ZCEEPRFX`: The high-level qualifier for the z/OS Connect data set.
*   `USER.LOAD.LIB`: The name of the PDSE library where the load module will be stored.
