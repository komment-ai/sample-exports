## Description
The `./source/jcl/vsam.jcl` file is a job control language (JCL) script used to define and manage VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) data sets for a CICS (Customer Information Control System) application. It is a critical component of the project, as it enables the creation and manipulation of VSAM data sets required by the CICS program.

## Usage instructions
**Step 1: Update the JCL script with the actual VSAM data set name**

Replace `<CICS.VSAM.FILE>` with the actual name of the VSAM data set for the CICS sample program CLAIMCI0.

**Step 2: Customize the VSAM data set parameters**

Review and modify the VSAM data set parameters, such as `KEYS`, `RECORDS`, `VOLUMES`, `SHAREOPTIONS`, `FREESPACE`, and `RECORDSIZE`, as needed to suit the requirements of the CICS application.

**Step 3: Run the JCL script**

Submit the JCL script to the mainframe to execute the IDCAMS (IBM Data Compression and Management System) program, which will create or modify the VSAM data set according to the specifications in the script.

## Implementation details
The JCL script uses the IDCAMS program to perform the following actions:

* Delete the existing VSAM data set (if it exists)
* Define a new VSAM cluster with the specified parameters
* Create a VSAM data set and index
* List the catalog entries for the VSAM data set

The script uses JCL syntax and IDCAMS commands to interact with the mainframe and manage the VSAM data sets. The `DELETE`, `DEFINE`, and `LISTCAT` commands are used to perform the necessary actions.
