## Description

The `./source/` directory contains the core components of the CICS application, including COBOL source code, JCL scripts, and configuration files. This directory holds the essential building blocks for the application's functionality.


## Contents

The directory is organized into subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose:

* `./source/jcl/`: Contains JCL (Job Control Language) scripts used for compiling and executing COBOL programs, defining CICS resources, and handling VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) files.
* `./source/config/`: Holds configuration files for the application, including server settings (`server.xml`) and claims-related properties (`claims.properties` and `claims.json`).
* `./source/cobol/`: Contains COBOL source code files, including copybooks (`*.cpy`) and programs (`*.cbl`), which implement the application's business logic.


## Purpose

The contents of the `./source/` directory are used to build, deploy, and execute the CICS application. The COBOL programs, JCL scripts, and configuration files work together to provide the application's functionality, which appears to be related to claims processing.
