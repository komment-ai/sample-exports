## Description

The `.gitignore` file is a configuration file used by Git to determine which files and directories to ignore in a project. It is used to prevent certain files from being tracked by version control, such as build artifacts, temporary files, and sensitive configuration files. This file is essential for maintaining a clean and organized Git repository.


## Implementation details

The `.gitignore` file contains a list of patterns and file names that Git should ignore. Each line in the file specifies a file or directory to ignore, and Git will exclude these files from version control.

Some examples of patterns and file names in the `.gitignore` file include:

* `*.apk`: Ignores all files with the `.apk` extension, which are typically Android application packages.
* `*.dex`: Ignores all files with the `.dex` extension, which are typically compiled Java classes for Android.
* `bin/` and `gen/`: Ignores the `bin` and `gen` directories, which are typically used for build artifacts.
* `local.properties`: Ignores the `local.properties` file, which is typically used for local configuration settings.
* `.idea/` and `.gradle/`: Ignores the `.idea` and `.gradle` directories, which are typically used for IDE and build tool configuration.

By ignoring these files and directories, the `.gitignore` file helps to keep the Git repository clean and focused on the project's source code.
