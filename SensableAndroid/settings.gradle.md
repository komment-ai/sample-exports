## Description

The `settings.gradle` file is a configuration file used by the Gradle build tool to define the structure of the project. It specifies which modules or subprojects are included in the build, and how they are organized.

In this project, the `settings.gradle` file is used to include two subprojects, `library` and `client`, in the build. This allows Gradle to manage the dependencies and build process for these subprojects.


## Implementation details

The file contains a single line of code:
```
include ':library', ':client'
```
This line tells Gradle to include the `library` and `client` subprojects in the build. The `include` keyword is used to specify the subprojects, and the `:` notation is used to indicate that these are subprojects rather than external dependencies.

By including these subprojects in the build, Gradle can manage their dependencies and build processes, and ensure that they are properly compiled and packaged as part of the overall project.


## Usage instructions

**Step 1: Create a new subproject**
To add a new subproject to the build, simply create a new directory for the subproject and add a `build.gradle` file to it. Then, update the `settings.gradle` file to include the new subproject.

**Step 2: Update the settings.gradle file**
To include a new subproject in the build, add its name to the `include` statement in the `settings.gradle` file. For example:
```
include ':library', ':client', ':new-subproject'
```
**Step 3: Run the build**
After updating the `settings.gradle` file, run the Gradle build command to rebuild the project. This will ensure that the new subproject is properly included in the build.
