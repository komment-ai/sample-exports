## Description

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is a part of the Gradle wrapper, a tool that allows the project to use a specific version of Gradle without requiring it to be installed on the system. The Gradle wrapper is used to build and manage the project, and the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is a key component of this process.


## Implementation details

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is a Java archive file that contains the Gradle wrapper code. It is used in conjunction with the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file to configure the Gradle wrapper and specify the version of Gradle to use.

When the project is built, the Gradle wrapper is executed, and it uses the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file to download and install the specified version of Gradle. The Gradle wrapper then uses the installed Gradle version to build and manage the project.

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file is not intended to be used directly by developers, but rather as a behind-the-scenes component of the Gradle wrapper. However, understanding its role in the project can be helpful in troubleshooting and managing the build process.
