## Introduction

Welcome to the SensableAndroid wiki, your comprehensive guide to understanding and working with the SensableAndroid software repository. This project is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for Android-based sensing applications. With its modular architecture and extensive feature set, SensableAndroid is an ideal choice for developers and researchers looking to create innovative sensing solutions.


## Description

The SensableAndroid repository is an open-source Android project that enables the creation of sensing applications for various domains, including environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart cities. The project's primary purpose is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for developing sensing applications that can collect, process, and visualize sensor data from various sources.

The repository consists of two main components:

*   **Library**: A reusable Android library that provides the core functionality for sensing applications, including data collection, processing, and visualization.
*   **Client**: A sample Android application that demonstrates the usage of the library and provides a user interface for interacting with sensing applications.


## Architecture

The SensableAndroid architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing developers to easily integrate new sensing components and features. The high-level architecture can be broken down into the following components:

*   **Sensable Service**: A background service that manages the sensing applications and provides a interface for interacting with the sensing components.
*   **Sensing Components**: A set of reusable components that provide the core sensing functionality, including data collection, processing, and visualization.
*   **Data Storage**: A storage mechanism that allows sensing data to be stored and retrieved for later analysis.
*   **User Interface**: A user interface that provides a way for users to interact with the sensing applications and view the collected data.
