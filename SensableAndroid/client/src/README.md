## Description

The `./client/src/` directory contains the source code for the client-side application of the SensableAndroid project. This directory is responsible for the user interface and user experience of the application, and it interacts with the library module (located in the `./library/` directory) to access the SensableService and other functionality.


## Directory Structure

The directory is organized into several subdirectories, each containing specific types of files:

* `main/java/`: This directory contains the Java source code for the client-side application, including activities, fragments, adapters, and other classes.
* `main/res/`: This directory contains the resources for the client-side application, including layouts, drawables, values, and menus.
* `main/assets/`: This directory contains the assets for the client-side application, including images and other files.


## Key Components

Some of the key components of the client-side application include:

* `MainActivity.java`: The main activity of the application, which serves as the entry point for the user.
* `SensableActivity.java`: An activity that displays information about a specific sensable.
* `SensableLoginFragment.java`: A fragment that handles user login and authentication.
* `SensorHelper.java`: A utility class that provides helper methods for working with sensors.
* `ScheduleHelper.java`: A utility class that provides helper methods for working with scheduled sensables.


## Functionality

The client-side application provides several key features, including:

* User login and authentication
* Display of sensable information
* Ability to create and edit sensables
* Ability to schedule sensables
* Display of scheduled sensables
