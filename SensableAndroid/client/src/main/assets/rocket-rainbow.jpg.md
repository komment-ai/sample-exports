## Description

The `rocket-rainbow.jpg` file is an image asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a JPEG image file that is part of the project's assets and is likely used as a visual element in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

The image is stored in the `client/src/main/assets` directory, which suggests that it is used by the client-side application. The file is not accompanied by any code, so its usage is likely defined in other parts of the project. The image is likely used to add visual appeal or to represent a specific concept or idea in the application.
