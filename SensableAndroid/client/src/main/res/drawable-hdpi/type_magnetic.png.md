## Description

The `type_magnetic.png` file is a high-density pixel (hdpi) image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is likely used to represent a magnetic sensor type in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details


The image is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which is used for devices with high-density screens. The image is used in conjunction with other sensor type images (e.g., `type_lux.png`, `type_gravity.png`) to provide a visual representation of different sensor types in the application.

No further implementation details are available, as the file is a binary image resource.
