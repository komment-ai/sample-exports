## Description

The `type_gravity.png` file is a graphical resource used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a high-density (hdpi) image representing a gravity sensor type.


## Implementation details

This image is likely used to visually represent a gravity sensor in the application's user interface. It is one of several sensor type images, including `type_lux.png`, `type_accelerometer.png`, and `type_orientation.png`, among others.

The image is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for high-density screens. The project also includes versions of this image in other directories, such as `drawable-xhdpi` and `drawable-xxhdpi`, to support different screen densities.

The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical resources and layout files to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface for the application.
