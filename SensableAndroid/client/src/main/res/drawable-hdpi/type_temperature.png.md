## Description

The `type_temperature.png` file is a graphical image used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-density image (hdpi) and is likely used as an icon or visual representation of temperature-related data within the app.


## Implementation details


This image is one of several icons used in the application to represent different types of data, including temperature, humidity, and acceleration. The image is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which contains images optimized for high-density displays.

The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in lists or detail views, to provide a visual representation of temperature-related data. The application may use this image in conjunction with text labels or other visual elements to display temperature information to the user.

Note that this file does not contain any code or executable logic. It is a static image file used for visual purposes only.
