## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/type_noise.png` is a high-density pixel (hdpi) image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is a graphical representation of a noise sensor type and is likely used as an icon or visual indicator in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

This image file is part of a set of resources used to represent different sensor types in the application. The file is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which is a standard directory in Android projects for storing high-density pixel images. The image is likely used in conjunction with other resources, such as layout files and Java code, to display the sensor type in the application.

The image file is a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, which is a common format for images used in Android applications. The file is not a code file, so there are no functions or classes to describe.


## Usage instructions

This image file is not intended to be used directly by the end-user. Instead, it is used by the application to display a visual representation of a noise sensor type. To use this image file in the application, follow these steps:

* **Step 1: Add the image file to the project**
Add the `type_noise.png` file to the `drawable-hdpi` directory in the Android project.
* **Step 2: Reference the image file in a layout**
Reference the image file in a layout file (e.g. `sensable_list_row.xml`) using the `android:drawable` attribute.
* **Step 3: Use the layout in the application**
Use the layout file in the application to display the noise sensor type.
