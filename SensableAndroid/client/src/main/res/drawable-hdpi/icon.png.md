## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png` is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-density (hdpi) version of the application's icon, which is used on devices with high-density displays.


## Implementation details

This file is a binary image file in PNG format, and its contents cannot be displayed here. It is one of several versions of the icon, each optimized for a different screen density (e.g. mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi). The Android operating system will choose the most suitable version of the icon based on the device's screen density.

The icon is likely used in various places throughout the application, such as the launcher icon, the action bar, and the navigation drawer. Its design and appearance are an important part of the application's visual identity and branding.

Note that this file does not contain any code, so there are no usage instructions or implementation details to discuss.
