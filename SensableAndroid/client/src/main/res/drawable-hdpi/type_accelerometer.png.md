## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/type_accelerometer.png` file is a high-density image resource used in the Sensable Android application to represent an accelerometer sensor type. This image is part of a set of icons used to visually distinguish between different sensor types in the application.


## Implementation details

This image is a PNG file, which is a widely supported format for web and mobile applications. The image is designed to be used at high density (hdpi) resolutions, which is suitable for high-resolution Android devices.

The image is used in various parts of the application, such as in lists and detail views, to provide a visual representation of the accelerometer sensor type. The image is likely used in conjunction with other sensor type icons to provide a consistent visual language throughout the application.

As this is a binary image file, there is no code to explain or describe. The image is simply a resource used by the application to enhance the user experience.
