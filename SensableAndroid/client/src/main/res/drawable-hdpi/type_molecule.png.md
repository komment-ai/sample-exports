## Description

The `type_molecule.png` file is a high-density display (hdpi) image used in the Sensable Android project. It is one of several icon images used to represent different types of sensors or data sources, such as molecule, lux, gravity, and accelerometer. The image is used to visually distinguish between different types of sensors or data sources in the application's user interface.



## Implementation details

The image is a part of the project's resources and is used by the application to display a molecule icon in various contexts, such as in lists or on buttons. The image is likely used in conjunction with other images and layout files to create a visually consistent and user-friendly interface.

* `drawable-hdpi`: The directory where the image is stored, indicating that it is designed for high-density displays.
* `type_molecule.png`: The file name of the image, indicating that it represents a molecule sensor or data source.
