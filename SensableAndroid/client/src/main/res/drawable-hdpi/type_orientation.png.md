## Description

The `type_orientation.png` file is a graphical image used in the Sensable Android application to represent the orientation sensor type. It is a part of the project's resources and is used to provide a visual icon for the orientation sensor in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image that is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for high-density displays. The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in lists or menus, to provide a visual representation of the orientation sensor.

Note that this file is not a code file, so there are no usage instructions or code explanations to provide. The image is simply a graphical resource that is used to enhance the application's user interface.
