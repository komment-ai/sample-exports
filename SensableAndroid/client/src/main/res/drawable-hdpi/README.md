## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/` directory contains high-density pixel (hdpi) image assets for the client application. These assets are used to provide visually appealing graphics and icons for the app's user interface.


## Contents

The directory contains a variety of image files in different formats (e.g., PNG, XML) that represent various icons, buttons, and other graphical elements used throughout the app. These images are designed to be used on devices with high-density pixel displays.


## Image Assets

Some examples of image assets found in this directory include:

* `icon.png`: The app's icon
* `type_lux.png`: An icon representing a lux sensor
* `type_gravity.png`: An icon representing a gravity sensor
* `type_accelerometer.png`: An icon representing an accelerometer sensor
* `favourite.png`: An icon representing a favorite or bookmarked item
* `unfavourite.png`: An icon representing an unfavorited or unbookmarked item


## Usage

These image assets are used throughout the client application to provide a visually consistent and appealing user interface. They are referenced in the app's layout files and are used to display icons, buttons, and other graphical elements.


## Screen Density

The `hdpi` directory is used to store image assets for devices with high-density pixel displays. Android devices are categorized into several screen density buckets, including:

* ldpi (low-density pixels)
* mdpi (medium-density pixels)
* hdpi (high-density pixels)
* xhdpi (extra-high-density pixels)
* xxhdpi (extra-extra-high-density pixels)

By providing image assets in different density buckets, the app can ensure that it looks great on a wide range of devices with varying screen resolutions.
