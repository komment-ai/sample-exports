## Description


The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/type_gyroscope.png` is a high-density pixel (hdpi) image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is a graphical representation of a gyroscope sensor type and is likely used as an icon or visual indicator within the application's user interface.

The image is part of a set of sensor type icons, including accelerometer, gravity, humidity, magnetic, noise, orientation, pressure, and temperature, which are used to visually distinguish between different types of sensors. These icons are used throughout the application to provide a consistent and intuitive visual language for users.


## Implementation details


The image is a PNG file, which is a raster graphics format that supports lossless compression. The hdpi designation indicates that the image is designed for high-density pixel displays, which typically have a pixel density of around 240 pixels per inch (PPI).

The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical resources, such as layouts and styles, to create a visually consistent and engaging user interface. The application's code may reference this image file using its resource ID, which is automatically generated by the Android build process.


## Usage instructions

## Additional notes


The image file is part of a larger set of graphical resources used in the Sensable Android application. The application's code and other resources, such as layouts and styles, work together to create a visually consistent and engaging user interface.
