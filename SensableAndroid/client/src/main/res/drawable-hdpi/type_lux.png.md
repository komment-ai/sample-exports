## Description

A PNG image file representing the type "lux" used in the Sensable Android application.


## Implementation details

This image file is used as an icon or visual representation for the "lux" type in the application's UI. It is part of a set of images used to represent different types, including gravity, accelerometer, orientation, and temperature.

The image is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` folder, indicating that it is designed for high-density displays. The application may use this image in various contexts, such as in lists, buttons, or other UI elements.

The image file is a binary file and does not contain any code or executable content. Its purpose is solely to provide a visual representation for the "lux" type in the application.
