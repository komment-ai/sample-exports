## Description

The `type_pressure.png` file is a graphical resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is an image file that represents a pressure sensor type and is used to visually identify this type of sensor within the application. The file is a part of the project's resources and is used to enhance the user interface.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image, which is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The image is used in various parts of the application, such as in lists, menus, and other UI components, to provide a visual representation of the pressure sensor type.

As this is an image file, there are no specific functions, methods, or classes to describe. However, it is worth noting that the image is used in conjunction with other resources, such as layout files and Java code, to create the application's user interface.
