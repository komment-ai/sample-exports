## Description

The `strings.xml` file is a resource file in the Android project that contains all the string constants used throughout the application. It is used to store text that is displayed to the user, such as button labels, titles, and messages. This file allows developers to manage and maintain all the text in one place, making it easier to translate the application into different languages and update text without having to modify the code.


## Usage instructions

No usage instructions are provided for this file, as it is a resource file that is used by the Android application, and its usage is handled by the Android framework.


## Implementation details

The `strings.xml` file contains a list of string resources, each identified by a unique name. These resources can be accessed from the application code using the `R.string` class.

Some examples of string resources in this file include:

* `app_name`: The name of the application, displayed in the launcher and other places.
* `button_list_sensors`: The label for a button that creates a new sensable.
* `title_activity_sensable`: The title of the activity that displays sensable information.
* `about_text`: A long piece of text that describes the application and its features.

These string resources are used throughout the application to display text to the user. By storing them in a single file, developers can easily manage and maintain the text in the application.
