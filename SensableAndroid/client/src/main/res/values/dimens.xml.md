## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml` file is a resource file in the Android project that defines dimension values used throughout the application. These dimension values are used to specify the size of various elements in the application's user interface, such as margins, padding, and text sizes.


## Implementation details

The file defines two dimension values:

* `activity_horizontal_margin`: specifies the horizontal margin for activities, set to 16dp.
* `activity_vertical_margin`: specifies the vertical margin for activities, set to 16dp.

These values are used to maintain consistency in the application's layout and to follow the Android Design guidelines. By defining these values in a separate file, they can be easily modified or updated in one place, rather than having to search and replace throughout the code.

Note that the `dp` unit is used to specify the dimension values, which stands for "density-independent pixels". This unit is used to ensure that the application's layout is consistent across different screen densities and sizes.
