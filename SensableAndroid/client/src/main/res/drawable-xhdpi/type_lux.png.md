## Description

The `type_lux.png` file is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-resolution image (xhdpi) representing a lux sensor type, likely used as an icon in the app's user interface. The image is part of a set of sensor type icons, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature, among others.


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a widely supported format for graphics in Android applications. The file is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, indicating that it is designed for use on devices with extra-high-density screens. The image is likely used in various parts of the app, such as in lists of available sensors or in detailed views of individual sensors.

As a graphical asset, the `type_lux.png` file does not contain any executable code or complex logic. Its purpose is solely to provide a visual representation of a lux sensor type, making it easier for users to identify and interact with this type of sensor in the app.
