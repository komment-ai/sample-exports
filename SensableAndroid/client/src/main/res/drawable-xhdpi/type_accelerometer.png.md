## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/type_accelerometer.png` is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-resolution icon representing an accelerometer sensor, which is one of the types of sensors that the application can interact with. This image is used in the user interface to visually represent the accelerometer sensor type.


## Implementation details

This image is part of the application's resources and is used in conjunction with other sensor type icons to provide a visual representation of the different sensors that the application supports. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for extra-high-density displays.

- The image is used in the application's UI to represent the accelerometer sensor type.
- The image is part of a set of sensor type icons that are used throughout the application.
