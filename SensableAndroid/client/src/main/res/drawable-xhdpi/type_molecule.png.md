## Description


The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/type_molecule.png` is a high-density image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It represents a molecule type icon, which is likely used to visually distinguish between different types of sensables or sensors within the app. This image is part of a set of icons for various sensor types, including gravity, accelerometer, orientation, temperature, gyroscope, and pressure.


## Implementation Details


This image is a PNG file, which is a raster graphics format that supports lossless compression. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, indicating that it is designed for extra-high-density displays. This means that the image will be used on devices with a high pixel density, such as high-end smartphones or tablets.

The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in lists, menus, or detail views, to provide a visual representation of the molecule type. The image may be resized or scaled depending on the device's screen density and the application's layout requirements.
