## Description

The `type_humidity.png` file is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android project. It is an icon representing humidity, which is likely used in the user interface to display or represent humidity-related data.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image, which is a widely-supported format for graphics. It is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` folder, indicating that it is intended for use on devices with extra-high density displays. The file is likely used in conjunction with other icons and graphics in the project to provide a visually consistent and engaging user experience.

The image is used to represent humidity, which is a type of sensor data that can be collected and displayed by the Sensable Android app. The image may be used in various contexts, such as in a list of available sensors, in a graph or chart displaying humidity data, or as an icon on a button or menu item related to humidity.

No diagram is necessary for this file, as it is a simple graphical asset with no complex logic or architecture.
