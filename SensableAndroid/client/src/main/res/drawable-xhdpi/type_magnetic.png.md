## Description

The `type_magnetic.png` file is a graphical asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a high-density (xhdpi) image that represents a magnetic sensor type. The image is likely used as an icon or visual indicator in the application's user interface to distinguish magnetic sensors from other types of sensors.


## Implementation details

The image is a part of the application's drawable resources, which are used to provide visual elements for the user interface. The `drawable-xhdpi` folder contains images that are optimized for high-density screens, ensuring that the image appears clear and crisp on devices with high-resolution displays.

As a graphical asset, the `type_magnetic.png` file does not contain any executable code or logic. Its purpose is solely to provide a visual representation of a magnetic sensor type, which is used to enhance the user experience and provide a clear indication of the sensor type being represented.


## Usage instructions

There are no specific usage instructions for this file, as it is a graphical asset that is used by the application's code. However, developers working on the SensableAndroid project should be aware of the following:

* The image is used to represent magnetic sensors in the application's user interface.
* The image is optimized for high-density screens and should be used in conjunction with other xhdpi resources.
* The image can be replaced or updated by modifying the `type_magnetic.png` file in the `drawable-xhdpi` folder.
