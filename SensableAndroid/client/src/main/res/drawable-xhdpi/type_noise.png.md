## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/type_noise.png` is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It represents a noise type icon, which is likely used to display a specific type of sensor data or measurement in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

This image resource is part of a larger set of icons used to represent different types of sensor data, such as acceleration, orientation, temperature, and more. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for use on devices with extra-high-density displays.

* The image is likely used in the application's UI to provide a visual representation of noise type data.
* The image may be displayed in a list view, grid view, or other UI component to help users quickly identify the type of data being displayed.
* The image may also be used in conjunction with other icons or graphics to create a visually appealing and intuitive UI.
