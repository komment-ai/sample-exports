## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/type_gyroscope.png` is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-resolution image (xhdpi) representing a gyroscope sensor type. This image is likely used as an icon or visual indicator in the application's user interface to represent a gyroscope sensor.


## Implementation details

This image is part of a larger set of graphical assets used in the application to represent different sensor types. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which is a standard location for high-resolution images in Android applications.

The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and layout files to create the application's user interface. The specific usage of this image is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is likely used in a layout file or activity to display a gyroscope sensor icon.

No further sections are necessary for this file, as it is a simple graphical asset.
