## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/icon.png` is a high-density (xhdpi) image file used as an icon in the Sensable Android application. It is part of the client-side resources and is used to display an icon representing the application.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image that is designed to be used on high-density displays (xhdpi). It is likely used as the application's launcher icon or as an icon within the application itself. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which is a standard location for high-density images in Android applications.


## Usage instructions

This file is not intended to be used directly by the end-user. Instead, it is used by the Android application to display an icon. However, developers working on the application may need to replace or update this image file as part of their development work.

* **Step 1: Locate the image file** 
  The image file is located in the `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi` directory.
* **Step 2: Replace or update the image file** 
  Developers can replace or update the image file by copying a new image into the same location, ensuring that it is named `icon.png` and is in the correct format (PNG).
* **Step 3: Verify the image is displayed correctly** 
  After updating the image file, developers should verify that the icon is displayed correctly within the application.
