## Description

The `type_orientation.png` file is an image resource used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a graphical representation of the orientation sensor type, which is one of the various sensor types used in the application. The image is used to visually identify the orientation sensor in the user interface, making it easier for users to recognize and interact with it.


## Implementation details

The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` folder, which indicates that it is designed for extra-high density displays. The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in sensor lists, settings, or other UI elements where the orientation sensor is referenced.

There are no specific functions, methods, or classes associated with this image file, as it is a static resource used for visual representation purposes only.
