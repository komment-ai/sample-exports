## Description

The `type_temperature.png` file is a graphical asset used in the SensableAndroid project to represent temperature-related data. It is a part of the project's user interface and is used to visually identify temperature-related sensors or data points.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image, optimized for xhdpi (extra-high density pixel) displays. It is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets to provide a consistent visual theme throughout the application. The image is used to represent temperature-related data, and may be displayed in various contexts, such as:

* Sensor icons
* Data point visualizations
* Graphs or charts

The image is likely used in the `SensableActivity` or `SensorHelper` classes, which are responsible for managing and displaying sensor data.
