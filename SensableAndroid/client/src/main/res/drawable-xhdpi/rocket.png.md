## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/rocket.png` file is a graphical image asset used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-resolution image designed for extra-high density (xhdpi) screens, and is likely used as an icon or logo within the application. The image is a part of the project's resources and is used to enhance the visual appearance of the application.


## Implementation details

The image file is a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, which is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The image is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which is a standard location for storing density-specific images in Android applications.

* The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in the main activity, fragments, or dialogs.
* The image may be used in conjunction with other images or graphics to create a visually appealing design.
* The image is designed to be scalable and can be resized to fit different screen densities and sizes.
