## Description

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is an image resource used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a notification icon representing a rocket, which is likely used to visually identify the app's notifications. The image is provided in various resolutions to support different device screen densities, including xhdpi (extra-high density), xxhdpi (extra-extra-high density), and hdpi (high density).


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a common format for graphics in Android development. The file is located in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, indicating that it is intended for use on devices with extra-high density screens. The file's name, `ic_stat_rocket.png`, follows the Android convention for naming icon resources, where `ic_` indicates an icon and `stat_` suggests a status icon.

The image is likely used in conjunction with the `Notification.Builder` class or other notification-related APIs to display the app's notifications with a custom icon. The different resolutions of the image (xhdpi, xxhdpi, hdpi) ensure that the icon appears correctly on devices with varying screen densities.

No diagram is necessary for this file, as it is a simple image resource.
