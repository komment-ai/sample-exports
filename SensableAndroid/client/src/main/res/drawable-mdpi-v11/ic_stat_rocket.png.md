## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi-v11/ic_stat_rocket.png` is a medium-density pixel (mdpi) image file used as a notification icon in the Sensable Android application. The image is a rocket icon and is used to represent the application in the notification area of an Android device.


## Implementation details

This image file is a part of the application's resources and is used to provide a visual representation of the application in the notification area. The image is designed to be used on medium-density pixel devices, which typically have a screen density of 160 dpi.

The image file is used in conjunction with other density-specific image files (e.g. ldpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi) to provide a consistent visual experience across different Android devices with varying screen densities.

Note that this file is a binary image file and does not contain any code or executable content. It is simply a visual resource used by the application.
