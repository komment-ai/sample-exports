## Description

The `type_temperature.png` file is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. Specifically, it is a medium-density (MDPI) image file that represents a temperature type icon. This icon is likely used throughout the application to visually represent temperature-related data or sensors.


## Implementation details

The image file is stored in the `drawable-mdpi` directory, which is a standard directory in Android applications for storing medium-density image resources. The image is likely used in various layouts and activities throughout the application, such as in the `sensable_list_row.xml` layout or the `SensableListAdapter` class.

Note that there are multiple versions of this image file in different directories (e.g. `drawable-xhdpi`, `drawable-xxhdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`) to support different screen densities and resolutions.
