## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/type_pressure.png` is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. Specifically, it is a medium-density (mdpi) image representing a pressure sensor type.


## Implementation details

This image is part of a set of icons used to visually represent different sensor types within the application. The image is stored in the `drawable-mdpi` folder, indicating that it is optimized for medium-density displays. The application likely uses this image to display a pressure sensor type in a list or other UI component.

The image is a static resource and does not contain any executable code. It is simply a visual asset used to enhance the user interface of the application.
