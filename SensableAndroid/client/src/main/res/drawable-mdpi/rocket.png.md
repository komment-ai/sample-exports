## Description

The `rocket.png` file is a medium-density image resource used in the Sensable Android application. It is part of the client-side codebase and is stored in the `drawable-mdpi` directory, which contains images optimized for medium-density screens. The image is likely used as an icon or graphic element within the application, possibly representing a rocket or a related concept.


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a widely-supported format for graphics. The file is stored in the `drawable-mdpi` directory, which is a standard location for image resources in Android applications. The image is likely used in conjunction with other image resources, such as `ic_stat_rocket.png`, which is also stored in the same directory.

The file does not contain any code, so there are no functions, methods, or classes to describe.


## Usage instructions

This file is an image resource and does not require any specific usage instructions. It is likely used by the application to display a rocket icon or graphic element, and is referenced in the application's code or layout files.


## Notes

The presence of multiple versions of the `rocket.png` file in different directories (e.g. `drawable-xhdpi`, `drawable-xxhdpi`, etc.) suggests that the application is designed to support multiple screen densities and resolutions. The `mdpi` version of the file is optimized for medium-density screens, which are typically used in older or lower-end Android devices.
