## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/type_accelerometer.png` is a medium-density pixel (mdpi) image used in the Sensable Android application to represent an accelerometer sensor type. It is one of several images used to visually distinguish between different types of sensors in the application.


## Implementation details

This image is likely used in conjunction with other images in the `drawable-mdpi` directory to provide a consistent visual representation of sensor types across different screen densities. The image is used in the application's user interface to help users identify and distinguish between different sensors.

Note that this file is a binary image file and does not contain any code or logic. Its purpose is solely to provide a visual representation of an accelerometer sensor type in the application.
