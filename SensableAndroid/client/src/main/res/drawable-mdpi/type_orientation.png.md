## Description

The `type_orientation.png` file is a graphical image used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a medium-density (mdpi) image, suggesting it is intended for use on devices with medium-resolution screens. The file is located in the `client/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi` directory, which is a standard location for storing images in an Android project.

The image is likely used to represent a type of sensor or data source related to device orientation, such as an accelerometer or gyroscope. It may be displayed in a list or grid of available sensors, or used as an icon to represent a specific sensor or data source.


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a common format for graphics in Android development. The file is not a code file, so there are no functions, methods, or classes to describe.

The image is likely used in conjunction with other images in the `drawable-mdpi` directory, which provide alternative resolutions for devices with different screen densities. The image may be referenced in layout files or Java code using its resource ID, which is automatically generated by the Android build process.

The image is part of the client-side code of the SensableAndroid project, which suggests it is used in the user interface or user experience of the application. The project appears to be an Android app that interacts with sensors and data sources, and the image is likely used to represent one of these sensors or data sources.
