## Description

The `type_gravity.png` file is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android project. It is a medium-density (mdpi) image that represents the concept of gravity, likely used as an icon or visual element in the application's user interface. The file is part of the project's resources and is used to provide visual cues to the user.


## Implementation details


* The file is a PNG image, which is a widely supported format for graphical assets in Android applications.
* The image is specifically designed for medium-density (mdpi) screens, which means it will be used on devices with a screen density of around 160 pixels per inch (PPI).
* The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and UI elements to provide a visually consistent and engaging user experience.
* The file is stored in the `res/drawable-mdpi` directory, which is a standard location for storing graphical assets in Android projects.
