## Description

The `type_lux.png` file is an image resource used in the Sensable Android application. Specifically, it is a medium-density pixel (MDPI) image that represents a lux type, likely used as an icon or visual indicator within the app. This image is part of the client-side resources and is used to enhance the user interface and user experience.


## Implementation details

The image is stored in the `drawable-mdpi` folder, which contains resources for medium-density pixel devices. The image is likely used in conjunction with other resources, such as layout files and Java code, to display the lux type icon in the app. The image is a static resource and does not contain any executable code.


## Usage instructions

This image resource is not intended to be used directly by the end-user. Instead, it is used by the app's developers to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface.

However, if a developer were to use this image resource, they would need to:

* **Step 1: Import the image resource** - The developer would need to import the `type_lux.png` image resource into their Android project.
* **Step 2: Reference the image resource** - The developer would need to reference the `type_lux.png` image resource in their layout file or Java code to display the image in the app.
* **Step 3: Use the image resource** - The developer would need to use the `type_lux.png` image resource as intended, such as displaying it as an icon or visual indicator in the app.
