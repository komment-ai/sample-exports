## Description

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is a high-density pixel (hdpi) image used as a status bar icon for the Sensable Android application. It is part of the client-side resources and is used to represent the application in the Android system's status bar.


## Implementation details

This image is a scalable PNG file, optimized for high-density pixel displays. It is used in conjunction with other images of the same name but with different pixel densities (e.g., `ic_stat_rocket.png` in the `drawable-xhdpi-v11` and `drawable-xxhdpi-v11` folders) to ensure that the icon is displayed correctly on various Android devices with different screen resolutions.

The image is likely used in the application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, where it is declared as the icon for the application or for a specific activity.

No diagram is necessary for this file, as it is a simple image resource.
