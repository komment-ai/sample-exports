## Description

The `type_noise.png` file is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android application. It is a high-resolution image (xxhdpi) that represents a noise type, which is likely used to display a specific type of sensor or data in the application.



## Implementation details

The image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory, which suggests that it is intended for use on devices with extra-extra-high-density displays. The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and layout files to display a consistent visual theme throughout the application.


No diagram is required for this file, as it is a simple graphical asset.
