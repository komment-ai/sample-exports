## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/type_gyroscope.png` is a high-resolution image file used in the Sensable Android project. It is a graphical representation of a gyroscope sensor type and is likely used as an icon or visual element in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

This image file is part of a set of icons used to represent different sensor types in the application. The image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for use on devices with extra-extra-high-density screens.

The image file is likely used in conjunction with other image files in the same directory to provide a consistent visual representation of different sensor types throughout the application.

Since this file is a binary image file, there is no code to explain or provide usage instructions for.
