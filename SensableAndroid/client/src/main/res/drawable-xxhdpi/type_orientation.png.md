## Description


The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/type_orientation.png` is an image resource used in the SensableAndroid project, specifically designed for xxhdpi (extra-extra-high-density) screen resolutions. This image is likely used to represent the orientation sensor type in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details


This image is part of a set of resources that provide visual representations for different sensor types, including orientation, gravity, accelerometer, and more. The image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory, which is used to store resources for devices with xxhdpi screen densities.

The image is likely used in various parts of the application, such as in the sensor list or details views, to provide a visual representation of the orientation sensor. The image's design and appearance are not described in this documentation, as it is a binary file and its contents are not human-readable.

No further sections are included, as this is a simple image resource file and does not require additional documentation.
