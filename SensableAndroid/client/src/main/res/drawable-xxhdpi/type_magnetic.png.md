## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/type_magnetic.png` is a high-resolution image used in the Sensable Android application to represent a magnetic sensor type. This image is part of a set of icons used to visually distinguish between different types of sensors in the application.


## Implementation details

This file is a PNG image file, which is a widely supported format for graphics. The image is likely to be used in the application's user interface to provide a visual representation of a magnetic sensor, making it easier for users to identify and understand the different types of sensors available.

The image is part of a larger set of icons, each representing a different type of sensor, such as acceleration, gravity, gyroscope, and more. These icons are likely to be used throughout the application, in various contexts, such as in lists, menus, and other UI elements.

The use of a high-resolution image (xxhdpi) ensures that the icon will be displayed clearly and crisply on high-density screens, providing a visually appealing and professional-looking user interface.


## Usage instructions

There are no specific usage instructions for this file, as it is a static image resource that is used by the application. However, developers working on the application may need to consider the following:

* **Step 1: Add the image to the project** - The image file should be added to the project's resources directory, in the correct density bucket (xxhdpi).
* **Step 2: Reference the image in the application** - The image can be referenced in the application's layout files or code, using the correct resource identifier.
* **Step 3: Test the image** - The image should be tested on various devices and screen densities to ensure that it is displayed correctly and looks visually appealing.
