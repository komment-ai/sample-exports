## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/type_lux.png` file is a high-density image asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a PNG image representing a type of sensor, specifically a lux sensor, which measures light intensity. This image is used in the user interface of the application to visually represent the lux sensor type.


## Implementation details

This image is part of a set of sensor type icons used throughout the application. The image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for use on devices with extra-extra-high-density displays. The image is used in various parts of the application, such as in lists and detail views, to provide a visual representation of the different sensor types.

No further sections are necessary for this file, as it is a simple image asset.
