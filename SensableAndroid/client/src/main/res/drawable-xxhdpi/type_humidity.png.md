## Description

A humidity type icon image used in the Sensable Android application. It is part of the drawable resources for the xxhdpi (extra-extra-high-density) screen resolution.


## Implementation details

This image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` folder, which contains resources for devices with a screen density of 480 dpi. The image is used to represent humidity-related data in the application.


## Usage instructions

This image is used internally by the application and does not require any direct interaction from the user. However, developers working on the application can use this image by referencing it in their layout files or Java code.


## Notes

The image is a part of a larger set of icons used in the application to represent different types of data, such as temperature, gravity, and accelerometer data. The image is designed to be used in conjunction with other UI elements to provide a visually consistent and intuitive user experience.
