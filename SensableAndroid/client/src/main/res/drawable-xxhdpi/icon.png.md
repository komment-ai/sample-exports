## Description

The `icon.png` file located in the `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/` directory is a high-resolution image asset used in the Sensable Android application. It is specifically designed for devices with extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens. The image is likely used as an icon or logo within the application, potentially on the main screen, navigation bar, or other prominent locations.


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a widely supported format for graphics. The xxhdpi directory indicates that this image is intended for high-resolution devices, and the application will use this image on devices with screens that match this density.

* `drawable-xxhdpi`: A directory containing image assets for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens.
* `icon.png`: A PNG image file used as an icon or logo within the application.

Note that the implementation details for an image file are relatively straightforward, and the main consideration is ensuring that the image is correctly sized and formatted for the intended use case.
