## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/rocket.png` file is a high-resolution image asset used in the project. Specifically, it is a PNG image of a rocket, designed for use on devices with extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens.


## Implementation details

The image is part of a set of assets used to represent different types of data or actions within the application. The `rocket.png` image is likely used as an icon or graphic element in various parts of the user interface, such as buttons, lists, or other visual components.

Note that this file is part of a larger set of image assets, with different versions provided for different screen densities (e.g., mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi). This allows the application to display the most suitable image for the device's screen resolution, ensuring optimal visual quality.
