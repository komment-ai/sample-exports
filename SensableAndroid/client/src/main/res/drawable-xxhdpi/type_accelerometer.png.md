## Description

The `type_accelerometer.png` file is a graphical image used in the SensableAndroid project to represent an accelerometer sensor type. It is part of the drawable resources for the project and is used to provide a visual icon for accelerometer-related functionality.


## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a widely-supported format for web and mobile applications. The file is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for use on devices with extra-extra-high-density displays.

As a graphical image, the file does not contain any code or executable logic. Instead, it is used as a visual asset to enhance the user interface of the application.

The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and layout files to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to interact with accelerometer-related functionality.
