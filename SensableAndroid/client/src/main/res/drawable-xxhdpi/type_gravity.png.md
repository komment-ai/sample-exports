## Description

The `type_gravity.png` file is an image resource used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a graphical representation of the gravity type and is likely used as an icon or visual indicator in the application's user interface.


## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image, which is a widely supported format for web and mobile applications. The image is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` folder, which indicates that it is designed for use on high-density displays (xxhdpi stands for extra-extra-high density pixels). The image is likely used in conjunction with other image resources to provide a consistent visual theme throughout the application.

No diagram is necessary for this simple image file.
