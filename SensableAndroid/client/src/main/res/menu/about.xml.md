## Description

The `about.xml` file is a menu resource file used in the SensableAndroid project. It defines a single menu item with the title "Settings" that can be displayed in the AboutActivity. The menu item is configured to not be shown as an action in the app bar.


## Usage instructions

There are no specific usage instructions for this file, as it is a resource file that is used by the Android system to display a menu. However, here are some general steps to use this file in the context of the SensableAndroid project:

*   **Step 1: Create an AboutActivity**
    Create an AboutActivity that will display the menu defined in this file.
*   **Step 2: Inflate the menu**
    In the AboutActivity, inflate the menu using the `MenuInflater` class.
*   **Step 3: Handle menu item clicks**
    Handle clicks on the menu item by overriding the `onOptionsItemSelected` method in the AboutActivity.


## Implementation details

The `about.xml` file contains a single menu item with the following attributes:

*   `android:id`: The ID of the menu item, which can be used to identify it in the code.
*   `android:title`: The title of the menu item, which is displayed in the menu.
*   `android:orderInCategory`: The order in which the menu item is displayed in the menu.
*   `app:showAsAction`: A flag that indicates whether the menu item should be displayed as an action in the app bar.

The menu item is defined using the `<item>` element, which is a child of the `<menu>` element. The `<menu>` element is the root element of the file and defines the namespace and schema for the menu.
