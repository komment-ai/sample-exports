## Description

A directory containing values for the project's user interface, specifically designed for screens with a width of 820dp or more. This directory is part of the client application and provides layout dimensions for large screen devices.


## Contents

The directory contains a single file, `dimens.xml`, which defines the dimensions for the user interface elements on large screen devices. These dimensions are used to create a consistent and visually appealing layout across different screen sizes.


## Usage

The values defined in this directory are used by the client application to render the user interface on large screen devices. The dimensions are applied to various layout elements, such as text views, buttons, and other UI components, to ensure a consistent and visually appealing layout.


## Relationship to Other Directories

This directory is part of the client application's resources directory, which contains various assets and values used by the application. The values defined in this directory are used in conjunction with other resources, such as layouts and drawables, to create a complete user interface.


## Layout Dimensions

The `dimens.xml` file contains a list of dimension values, defined in dp (density-independent pixels), that are used to size UI elements on large screen devices. These values are used to create a consistent layout across different screen sizes.
