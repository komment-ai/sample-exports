## Description

The `./client/src/main/res/values-w820dp/dimens.xml` file is a resource file in the Android project that defines dimension values for layouts and user interface elements. Specifically, it provides customized dimensions for screens with more than 820dp of available width, which includes 7" and 10" devices in landscape mode. This file is used to adjust the layout and spacing of UI elements to accommodate larger screen sizes.


## Implementation details

The file contains a single dimension resource, `activity_horizontal_margin`, which is set to 64dp. This value is used to define the horizontal margin of activities on larger screens. The file is designed to override the default dimension values defined in `res/values/dimens.xml` for larger screen sizes.

- `<dimen name="activity_horizontal_margin">64dp</dimen>`: A dimension resource that defines the horizontal margin of activities on larger screens.

Note that this file does not contain any code or complex logic, but rather provides a simple resource value that is used to customize the layout of the application on larger screens.
