## Description


The `./client/src/main/res/` directory contains the resources for the Android client application. These resources include:

*   Images (drawables) used in the application's UI, such as icons, logos, and sensor type images
*   Layout files (XML) that define the UI structure for various application screens and components
*   Values files (XML) that contain strings, colors, and dimensions used throughout the application
*   Menu files (XML) that define the options menus for certain application screens
*   Assets, such as images used in the application's UI

These resources are used to customize the appearance and behavior of the application, and are referenced in the application's Java code.


## Resource Types


The directory contains the following types of resources:

*   **Drawable resources**: Images used in the application's UI, such as icons and logos. These are stored in various subdirectories (e.g., `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, etc.) to provide different resolutions for different screen densities.
*   **Layout resources**: XML files that define the UI structure for application screens and components. These files are used to create the visual layout of the application's UI.
*   **Value resources**: XML files that contain strings, colors, and dimensions used throughout the application. These values can be referenced in the application's Java code to customize the appearance and behavior of the application.
*   **Menu resources**: XML files that define the options menus for certain application screens.


## Usage


The resources in this directory are used throughout the application's Java code to customize the appearance and behavior of the application. For example, an image resource might be referenced in a Java class to set the icon for a button, while a layout resource might be used to define the structure of a screen.
