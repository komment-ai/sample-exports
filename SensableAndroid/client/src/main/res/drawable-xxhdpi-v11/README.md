## Description

A directory containing high-density (xxhdpi) images for the project, specifically designed for devices with a high pixel density.


## Purpose

The images in this directory are used to provide high-quality visual assets for the application, ensuring that they appear sharp and clear on devices with high-resolution screens.


## Contents

The directory contains a single image file, `ic_stat_rocket.png`, which is a high-density version of the rocket icon used in the application.


## Usage

The images in this directory are used by the application to display visual elements, such as icons and graphics, on devices with high-density screens. The Android operating system automatically selects the correct density version of an image based on the device's screen density.


## Relationship to Other Directories

This directory is part of a larger set of directories that provide images for the application at different densities, including `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, and `drawable-xxhdpi`. The images in these directories are used to provide a consistent visual experience across devices with different screen densities.
