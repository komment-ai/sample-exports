## Description

The `unfavourite.png` file is a graphical asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is an image that represents the "unfavourite" action, likely used in a user interface element such as a button or icon. The image is stored in the `drawable` directory, which is a standard location for graphical assets in Android projects.


## Implementation details

The `unfavourite.png` file is a binary image file that contains the visual representation of the "unfavourite" action. It is likely used in conjunction with a corresponding "favourite" image, such as the `favourite.png` file also located in the `drawable` directory. The image is probably used in a context where users can mark or unmark items as favourites, such as in a list or grid view.

Note that there is also an `unfavourite_pressed.png` file in the same directory, which suggests that the image may have different states or variations depending on the user's interaction with it.
