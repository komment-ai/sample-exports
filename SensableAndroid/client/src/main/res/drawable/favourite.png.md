## Description

The `favourite.png` file is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android application. Specifically, it is a button image used to represent a "favourite" or "liked" state. This image is likely used throughout the application to allow users to mark certain items as their favourites.


## Implementation details

The `favourite.png` file is a static image asset that does not contain any executable code. It is a simple graphic that is displayed in the application's user interface. The image is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets, such as `unfavourite.png` and `favourite_pressed.png`, to provide visual feedback to the user when they interact with the favourite button.
