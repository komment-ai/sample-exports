## Description

The `icon.png` file is an image asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is located in the `client/src/main/res/drawable` directory, which suggests that it is a graphical resource used in the client-side application. The file is likely used as an icon or logo for the application, and may be displayed in various contexts such as the app launcher, notifications, or in-app UI elements.


## Implementation details

The `icon.png` file is a binary image file that contains pixel data representing the icon or logo. The file is not a code file, so there are no implementation details to discuss. However, it is worth noting that the file is likely used in conjunction with other graphical resources and layout files to create the visual appearance of the application.
