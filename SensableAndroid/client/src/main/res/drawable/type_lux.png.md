## Implementation details

The image is a PNG file, which is a common format for graphics and icons in Android applications. The file is stored in the `drawable` folder, which is a standard location for graphical assets in Android projects. The file is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and layouts to provide a visually consistent and engaging user interface.

- The image is used to represent the "lux" type in the application, which may be related to light sensors or illumination data.
- The image may be used in various contexts, such as in lists, grids, or detail views, to provide a visual cue to the user about the type of data being displayed.
