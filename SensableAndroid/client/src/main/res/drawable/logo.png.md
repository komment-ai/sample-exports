## Description

The `logo.png` file is a graphical image used in the Sensable Android application. It is located in the `client/src/main/res/drawable` directory, which is the standard location for storing images and other graphical resources in an Android project. The logo image is likely used to represent the application's branding and is displayed in various parts of the user interface.


## Implementation details

The `logo.png` file is a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image, which is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The image is likely used in various contexts throughout the application, such as in the action bar, navigation drawer, or as a splash screen.

As a graphical resource, the `logo.png` file does not contain any executable code or logic. Instead, it is a static image that is referenced and displayed by the application's code.


## Usage instructions

This section is not applicable to a graphical resource like `logo.png`, as it is not a code file that requires usage instructions.


## Additional notes

The `logo.png` file is likely referenced in various layout files and code snippets throughout the project. For example, it may be referenced in a layout file like `activity_sensable.xml` or `main_activity.xml` using the `android:drawable` attribute. Additionally, it may be used in code snippets that display the logo image, such as in a `ImageView` or `ActionBar` component.
