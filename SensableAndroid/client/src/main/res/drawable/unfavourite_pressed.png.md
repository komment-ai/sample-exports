## Description

The file `./client/src/main/res/drawable/unfavourite_pressed.png` is a graphical asset used in the Sensable Android application. It represents the "unfavourite" button in its pressed state. This image is likely used in the user interface to allow users to remove a favourite sensable (a sensor or device) from their list of favourites.


## Implementation details

This file is a PNG image and is stored in the `drawable` directory, which is a standard location for graphical assets in Android applications. The image is likely used in conjunction with the `favourite.png` and `favourite_pressed.png` images to provide a visual indication of the button's state. The image is used in the application's user interface to provide a way for users to interact with their favourite sensables.

No further sections are required as this is a graphical asset and does not contain code.
