## Description

The `type_temperature.png` file is a graphical icon used in the Sensable Android application to represent temperature-related data. It is one of several icons used to visually distinguish between different types of sensor data.


## Implementation details

The icon is a static image file, and as such, does not contain any executable code. It is simply a graphical asset used to enhance the user interface of the application.

The file is stored in the `drawable` directory, which is a standard location for graphical assets in Android applications. The file is likely used in conjunction with other graphical assets and layout files to create the visual representation of the application's user interface.

There are no non-trivial named functions, methods, or classes associated with this file, as it is simply a static image file.
