## Description

The `type_gyroscope.png` file is an image resource used in the SensableAndroid project to represent a gyroscope sensor. It is part of the client-side application and is likely used in the user interface to display information about the gyroscope sensor.


## Implementation details

The image is stored in the `drawable` directory, which is a standard location for image resources in Android projects. The file is provided in various resolutions (e.g., `drawable-xhdpi`, `drawable-xxhdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-mdpi`) to support different screen densities.

There are no specific implementation details to note, as this is a simple image file. However, it is likely used in conjunction with other code files, such as layout files or activity classes, to display the image in the user interface.
