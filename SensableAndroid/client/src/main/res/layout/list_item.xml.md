## Description

The `list_item.xml` file is a layout file used in the SensableAndroid project to define the user interface for a single list item. It is used to display a text label in a list view, and is likely used in conjunction with a list adapter to populate the list with data.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Create a list adapter**\n Create a list adapter that will be used to populate the list view with data. This adapter should use the `list_item.xml` layout file to define the layout of each list item.
* **Step 2: Inflate the layout**\n Inflate the `list_item.xml` layout file in the list adapter's `getView` method to create a view for each list item.
* **Step 3: Set the text label**\n Set the text label in the `list_item.xml` layout file to the desired text for each list item.


## Implementation details


The `list_item.xml` file defines a simple linear layout with a single text view. The text view has an ID of `lblListItem` and is set to fill the parent layout. The layout has a fixed height of 55dp and a vertical orientation.

* `LinearLayout`: The root layout of the file, which contains a single text view.
* `TextView`: The text view that displays the text label for each list item.

Note that this file is a simple layout file and does not contain any complex logic or functionality. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a list adapter to display a list of text labels.
