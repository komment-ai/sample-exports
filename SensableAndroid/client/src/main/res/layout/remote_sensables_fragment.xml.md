## Description

The `remote_sensables_fragment.xml` file is a layout file used in the Sensable Android application to display a list of remote sensables. It is a crucial part of the application's user interface, providing a way for users to view and interact with remote sensables.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Inflate the layout**\n The layout is inflated in the `RemoteSensablesFragment` class, which is a part of the application's fragment-based architecture.
* **Step 2: Populate the list**\n The list of remote sensables is populated using data retrieved from a remote server or a local database.
* **Step 3: Bind data to the list**\n The data is bound to the list using a custom adapter, which is responsible for rendering each item in the list.
* **Step 4: Handle user interactions**\n The application handles user interactions with the list, such as clicking on an item to view more details.


## Implementation details


The layout consists of a single `ListView` element, which is used to display the list of remote sensables. The `ListView` is configured to fill the entire screen and has a background color set to `#4cbc47`.

The layout is inflated and populated with data in the `RemoteSensablesFragment` class, which is responsible for managing the fragment's lifecycle and user interactions.

The custom adapter used to bind data to the list is not shown in this file, but it is likely defined in a separate Java class.

The application's architecture and design patterns are not explicitly shown in this file, but it is likely that the application uses a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to separate concerns and manage complexity.

* `RemoteSensablesFragment`: A fragment class that inflates and populates the layout, and handles user interactions.
* `CustomAdapter`: A custom adapter class that binds data to the list and renders each item.
