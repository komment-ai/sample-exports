## Description

The `list_group.xml` file is a layout file used in the SensableAndroid project to define the visual structure of a list group in the application's user interface. It is a crucial component in displaying data to the user in an organized and visually appealing manner. This layout file is used in conjunction with other layout files and Java code to create the overall UI of the application.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Include the layout file in the project**\n The `list_group.xml` file should be included in the project's layout directory (`client/src/main/res/layout/`) to be accessible by the application's activities and fragments.
* **Step 2: Inflate the layout in Java code**\n The layout file can be inflated in Java code using the `LayoutInflater` class, which converts the XML layout into a View object that can be used in the application.
* **Step 3: Customize the layout as needed**\n The layout file can be customized by modifying the XML code to change the appearance and behavior of the list group. This can include adding or removing views, changing view properties, and adding event listeners.
* **Step 4: Use the layout in an activity or fragment**\n The inflated layout can be used in an activity or fragment by setting it as the content view or adding it to a ViewGroup.


## Implementation details


The `list_group.xml` file defines a `LinearLayout` with a vertical orientation, which contains a single `TextView` with the ID `lblListHeader`. The `LinearLayout` has a black background and 8dp padding, while the `TextView` has a yellow text color and a text size of 17dp.

* `LinearLayout`: The root view of the layout, which contains the `TextView` and defines the overall structure of the list group.
* `TextView`: A view that displays text, used to display the header of the list group.
