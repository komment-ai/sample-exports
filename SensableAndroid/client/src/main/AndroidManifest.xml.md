## Description

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file is a crucial configuration file in the Android application project. It provides essential information about the application to the Android system, such as the application's package name, version, and components (activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers). The file also declares the permissions required by the application and specifies the minimum and target SDK versions.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Declare application components**\n Declare all application components, including activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers, in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This is necessary for the Android system to recognize and interact with these components.
* **Step 2: Specify permissions**\n Request the necessary permissions for the application to function correctly. This includes permissions for accessing the internet, location services, and other sensitive features.
* **Step 3: Define application metadata**\n Provide metadata about the application, such as its name, icon, and theme. This information is used by the Android system to display the application in the launcher and other system UI components.
* **Step 4: Configure intent filters**\n Define intent filters for activities and other components to specify the types of intents they can handle. This allows the Android system to route intents to the correct components.


## Implementation details


The `AndroidManifest.xml` file is an XML file that contains the following key elements:

* `manifest`: The root element of the file, which contains the application's package name, version, and other metadata.
* `application`: The element that contains the application's components, permissions, and other configuration settings.
* `activity`: The element that declares an activity component, including its name, label, and intent filter.
* `service`: The element that declares a service component, including its name and intent filter.
* `provider`: The element that declares a content provider component, including its name, authorities, and intent filter.
* `uses-permission`: The element that requests a permission for the application.
* `uses-sdk`: The element that specifies the minimum and target SDK versions for the application.

Some notable components declared in this file include:

* `ScheduledSensableService`: A service that schedules sensable data collection.
* `BootReceiver`: A broadcast receiver that listens for the `android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED` intent and starts the `ScheduledSensableService`.
* `SensableContentProvider`: A content provider that manages sensable data.
* `MainActivity`, `SensorListActivity`, `SensableActivity`, and `AboutActivity`: Activities that provide the user interface for the application.
