## description


A fragment responsible for displaying scheduled sensors in a list view. It initializes the list view and attaches a cursor loader to display data from a content provider.

## code_explanation


This class extends the `Fragment` class and implements the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks` interface to manage the loading of data from a content provider. The fragment is responsible for displaying a list of scheduled sensors in a list view, and it uses a cursor loader to load the data from the content provider.

The fragment's layout is inflated from the `R.layout.local_sensables_fragment` resource file, which defines the UI components of the fragment, including a list view and a text view to display an empty message.

The fragment uses a `SensableListAdapter` to display the data in the list view. The adapter is initialized with the data projection, which defines the columns of data to be displayed in each row of the list.

The fragment also implements the `onCreateLoader` method to create a cursor loader that retrieves data from the content provider. The loader is initialized with the content URI, projection, selection, selection arguments, and sort order.

The fragment's `onLoadFinished` method is called when the loader has finished loading the data, and it swaps the new cursor with the previous cursor to display the updated data in the list view.

The fragment's `onLoaderReset` method is called when the last cursor provided to `onLoadFinished` is about to be closed, and it swaps the cursor with a null value to signal to the adapter that no more data is available for display.

## additional_information


*   The `SensableListAdapter` class is used to display the data in the list view. It takes four parameters: the context, the resource ID of the list view, the cursor, and the data projection.
*   The `attachCursorLoader` method is used to attach a cursor loader to the list view. It takes a `ListView` object as a parameter and initializes the adapter and loader.
*   The `onCreateLoader` method is used to create a cursor loader that retrieves data from the content provider. It takes an integer ID and a bundle of arguments as parameters.
*   The `onLoadFinished` method is used to swap the new cursor with the previous cursor to display the updated data in the list view. It takes a loader and a cursor as parameters.
*   The `onLoaderReset` method is used to swap the cursor with a null value to signal to the adapter that no more data is available for display. It takes a loader as a parameter.
## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for LocalSensablesFragment**

### Using the LocalSensablesFragment

**Overview:**
The LocalSensablesFragment is a customizable UI component that displays a list of scheduled sensables in a user interface.

**Step 1: Import the Fragment**

* Import the LocalSensablesFragment into your Android application using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.client.views.LocalSensablesFragment;`

**Step 2: Add the Fragment to Your Activity**

* Add the LocalSensablesFragment to your Android activity by creating a new instance of the fragment and adding it to the activity's layout.
* Make sure to implement the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>` interface in your activity to handle loader events.

**Step 3: Configure the Fragment**

* Customize the fragment's appearance and behavior by passing additional arguments to the fragment's constructor.
* You can also override the fragment's methods to customize its behavior.

**Step 4: Display the Fragment**

* Display the LocalSensablesFragment in your Android activity by calling the `show()` method on the fragment.

**Step 5: Handle Loader Events**

* Implement the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>` interface in your activity to handle loader events.
* Override the `onCreateLoader()`, `onLoadFinished()`, and `onLoaderReset()` methods to handle loader events.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction;

public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity implements LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();

        LocalSensablesFragment localSensablesFragment = new LocalSensablesFragment();
        fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, localSensablesFragment);
        fragmentTransaction.commit();
    }

    @Override
    public Loader<Cursor> onCreateLoader(int id, Bundle args) {
        // Create and return a CursorLoader that will take care of
        // creating a Cursor for the data being displayed.
        return new CursorLoader(this, ScheduledSensableContentProvider.CONTENT_URI,
                SCHEDULED_SENSABLE_PROJECTION, null, null, null);
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoadFinished(Loader<Cursor> loader, Cursor data) {
        // Swap the new cursor in.  (The framework will take care of closing the
        // old cursor once we return.)

        mAdapter.swapCursor(data);
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoaderReset(Loader<Cursor> loader) {
        // This is called when the last Cursor provided to onLoadFinished()
        // above is about to be closed.  We need to make sure we are no
        // longer using it.
        mAdapter.swapCursor(null);
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the LocalSensablesFragment in your Android application.
