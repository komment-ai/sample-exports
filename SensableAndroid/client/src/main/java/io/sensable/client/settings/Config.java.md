## description


A Java class that holds configuration variables for the Sensable client settings. It provides a more efficient alternative to using property files, as it eliminates the need to load and parse files from disk.

## code_explanation


The `Config` class is designed to store configuration variables in a centralized location, making it easier to manage and maintain the application's settings. The use of a Java class instead of a property file reduces the overhead of file I/O operations and thread safety concerns.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `java.lang`: The Java language library is used for basic data types and operations.

### Third-party Libraries

## additional_information


*   The `Config` class is designed to be thread-safe, eliminating the need for synchronization when accessing its fields.
*   The use of `static final` fields ensures that the configuration variables are immutable and cannot be modified once initialized.
*   The `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_VERSION` field is an integer, indicating the current version of the SQLite database used by the Sensable client settings.
*   The `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_DUMP` field is a string, representing the filename for an on-disk SQLite database dump used for debugging purposes.
*   The `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB` field is a string, indicating the filename for the on-disk SQLite database where rule repository, item cache, and other structured data will be stored.
## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for Config Class**

### Using the Config Class

**Overview:**
The Config class is a utility class that holds configuration variables for the Sensable client settings. It provides static final strings for filenames of an SQLite database and a dump of the database, as well as a version number for the database.

**Step 1: Import the Config Class**

* Import the Config class into your Java application using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.client.settings.Config;`

**Step 2: Access Configuration Variables**

* Access the configuration variables using the static final fields provided by the Config class:
	+ `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB`: the filename of the on-disk SQLite database.
	+ `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_DUMP`: the filename for the on-disk SQLite database dump.
	+ `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_VERSION`: the current version of the SQLite database.

**Step 3: Use Configuration Variables**

* Use the configuration variables in your Java application as needed. For example, you can use the `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB` variable to construct a file path for the SQLite database.

**Step 4: Understand Configuration Variables**

* Note that the configuration variables are static final, meaning they cannot be changed once the application is running.
* The `SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_VERSION` variable represents the current version of the SQLite database, which may be used for compatibility or migration purposes.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import io.sensable.client.settings.Config;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Access configuration variables
        String dbFilename = Config.SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB;
        String dumpFilename = Config.SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_DUMP;
        int dbVersion = Config.SENSABLE_STORAGE_DB_VERSION;

        // Use configuration variables
        System.out.println("SQLite database filename: " + dbFilename);
        System.out.println("SQLite database dump filename: " + dumpFilename);
        System.out.println("SQLite database version: " + dbVersion);
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the Config class in your Java application.
