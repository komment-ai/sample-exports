## description


A Fragment that extends the Android Fragment class and provides a list of sensibles retrieved from an API endpoint. It initializes a RestAdapter to make API calls, creates an instance of the SensableService class, and uses a callback to receive the list of sensors in response. The fragment also initializes a ListView by creating an adapter to display a list of Sensable objects and adds an OnItemClickListener to handle item clicks and launch the SensableActivity.

## code_explanation


The RemoteSensablesFragment class extends the Android Fragment class and overrides the onCreateView and onStart methods. The onCreateView method inflates a layout from a resource file and returns the resulting view instance. The onStart method initializes a RestAdapter to make API calls, creates an instance of the SensableService class, and uses a callback to receive the list of sensors in response. The fragment also initializes a ListView by creating an adapter to display a list of Sensable objects and adds an OnItemClickListener to handle item clicks and launch the SensableActivity.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for RemoteSensablesFragment**

### Using the RemoteSensablesFragment

**Overview:**
The RemoteSensablesFragment is a Java class that extends Fragment and provides a list of sensibles retrieved from an API endpoint. The class has methods for initializing the list and adding an onclick listener to the listview.

**Step 1: Import the Fragment**

* Import the RemoteSensablesFragment class into your Android application using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.client.views.RemoteSensablesFragment;`

**Step 2: Create an Instance of the Fragment**

* Create an instance of the RemoteSensablesFragment class and add it to the activity's fragment manager using the following code: `RemoteSensablesFragment fragment = new RemoteSensablesFragment();`

**Step 3: Initialize the List**

* Initialize the list of sensibles by calling the `initialiseList()` method, which creates a `ListView` and sets up an adapter to display the list of sensibles.

**Step 4: Handle Item Clicks**

* Add an onclick listener to the listview by calling the `initialiseList()` method, which sets up an `OnItemClickListener` to handle item clicks and launch the `SensableActivity`.

**Step 5: Make API Calls**

* Make API calls to retrieve a list of sensors by calling the `onStart()` method, which initializes a `RestAdapter` and uses it to make a call to the `SensableService` class.

**Step 6: Display the List**

* Display the list of sensibles by adding the fragment to the activity's layout using the following code: `getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment).commit();`

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager;

public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        RemoteSensablesFragment fragment = new RemoteSensablesFragment();
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
        fragmentManager.beginTransaction().add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment).commit();
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the RemoteSensablesFragment in your Android application.

**Important Notes:**

* Make sure to add the necessary permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml file to access the API endpoint.
* Ensure that the API endpoint is properly configured and returns the expected data.
* The `SensableActivity` class is not included in this example, but it should be implemented to handle the item clicks and display the selected sensable's details.
