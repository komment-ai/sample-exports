## Description


The `./client/src/main/java/io/sensable/client/settings/` directory contains configuration settings for the client application. Currently, it includes a single Java class named `Config.java`, which likely holds constants and settings used throughout the client.


## Configuration Settings


The `Config.java` class is expected to contain static variables and methods that provide configuration settings for the client application. These settings may include API endpoints, database connection strings, or other constants that are used throughout the application.


## Usage


The configuration settings in this directory are likely used throughout the client application to provide a centralized location for configuration data. This allows for easier maintenance and updates to the application's configuration.
