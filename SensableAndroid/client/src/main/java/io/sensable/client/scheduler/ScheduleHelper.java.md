## description


A utility class that assists in managing scheduled tasks for a sensory system. It provides methods for creating and removing scheduled tasks, as well as querying the number of scheduled tasks and pending tasks. Additionally, it includes a method for updating the favourite object if available.

## code_explanation


The `ScheduleHelper` class is a utility class that provides methods for managing scheduled tasks for a sensory system. It uses Android's `AlarmManager` to schedule tasks and Android's Content Resolver to interact with the database. The class has methods for creating and removing scheduled tasks, querying the number of scheduled tasks and pending tasks, and updating the favourite object if available.

The class uses a Context object to access the Content Resolver and other resources needed for the operations. It also uses a variety of utility classes, such as `ScheduledSensablesTable` and `SavedSensablesTable`, to serialize and deserialize objects for storage in the database.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for ScheduleHelper Class**

### Using the ScheduleHelper Class

**Overview:**
The ScheduleHelper class is a utility class that assists in managing scheduled tasks for a sensory system. It provides methods for creating and removing scheduled tasks, as well as querying the number of scheduled tasks and pending tasks.

**Step 1: Import the ScheduleHelper Class**

* Import the ScheduleHelper class into your Android application using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.client.scheduler.ScheduleHelper;`

**Step 2: Create an Instance of the ScheduleHelper Class**

* Create an instance of the ScheduleHelper class, passing in the context of your application: `ScheduleHelper scheduleHelper = new ScheduleHelper(context);`

**Step 3: Set Up the Scheduler**

* Use the `startScheduler()` method to set up a scheduled task using AlarmManager: `scheduleHelper.startScheduler();`

**Step 4: Add Scheduled Tasks**

* Use the `addSensableToScheduler()` method to add a new scheduled task to the scheduler: `scheduleHelper.addSensableToScheduler(scheduledSensable);`

**Step 5: Remove Scheduled Tasks**

* Use the `removeSensableFromScheduler()` method to remove a scheduled task from the scheduler: `scheduleHelper.removeSensableFromScheduler(scheduledSensable);`

**Step 6: Query Scheduled Tasks**

* Use the `getScheduledTasks()` method to retrieve a cursor containing the scheduled tasks: `Cursor cursor = scheduleHelper.getScheduledTasks();`

**Step 7: Count Scheduled Tasks**

* Use the `countScheduledTasks()` method to retrieve the number of scheduled tasks: `int count = scheduleHelper.countScheduledTasks();`

**Step 8: Cancel the Scheduler**

* Use the `stopSchedulerIfNotNeeded()` method to cancel the scheduler if there are no scheduled tasks: `scheduleHelper.stopSchedulerIfNotNeeded();`

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.app.Application;
import io.sensable.client.scheduler.ScheduleHelper;

public class MyApplication extends Application {

    private ScheduleHelper scheduleHelper;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        scheduleHelper = new ScheduleHelper(this);
        scheduleHelper.startScheduler();
    }

    public ScheduleHelper getScheduleHelper() {
        return scheduleHelper;
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the ScheduleHelper class in your Android application.

**Important Notes:**

* Make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur when using the ScheduleHelper class.
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the AlarmManager and ContentResolver.
* The ScheduleHelper class assumes that you have a ContentProvider set up for managing scheduled tasks.
