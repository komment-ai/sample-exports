## Description

A directory containing Java classes that represent the user interface components of the Sensable Android application. These classes define the layout and behavior of various screens and fragments within the app, including lists of sensables, login screens, and detail views for individual sensables.


## Contents

The directory contains the following classes:

* `FavouriteSensablesFragment.java`: a fragment that displays a list of favorited sensables
* `LocalSensablesFragment.java`: a fragment that displays a list of local sensables
* `RemoteSensablesFragment.java`: a fragment that displays a list of remote sensables
* `SensableListAdapter.java`: an adapter that provides data to the sensable list views

These classes work together to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with sensables, including browsing, favoriting, and viewing details.
