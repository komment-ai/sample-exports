## description


An Android Activity that displays information about the application and retrieves statistics from the Sensable API. It uses the Retrofit library to make HTTP requests to the API and updates a TextView with the retrieved statistics.

## code_explanation


The `AboutActivity` class extends the `Activity` class and overrides the `onCreate` method to set up the user interface and load the statistics from the Sensable API. The `loadStatistics` method uses the Retrofit library to make a GET request to the Sensable API and retrieve the statistics. The `success` method is called when the request is successful, and it logs the statistics to the logcat and updates the TextView with the retrieved count. The `failure` method is called when the request fails, and it logs the error message and makes the TextView invisible.

## additional_information


*   The `loadStatistics` method uses the Retrofit library to make a GET request to the Sensable API. This request is made on the main thread, which may cause the UI to freeze. To avoid this, the request should be made on a background thread using an AsyncTask or a Thread.
*   The `success` method logs the statistics to the logcat, which may cause the logcat to become cluttered. To avoid this, the logging level should be set to a lower level, such as DEBUG.
*   The `failure` method makes the TextView invisible when the request fails. This may cause the UI to become inconsistent. To avoid this, the TextView should be made visible again when the request is successful.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for AboutActivity Class**

### Using the AboutActivity Class

**Overview:**
The AboutActivity class is a custom Android activity that displays information about the Sensable service, including statistics.

**Step 1: Import the Class**

* Import the AboutActivity class into your Android project using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.client.AboutActivity;`

**Step 2: Configure the Activity**

* Configure the activity's layout by creating a layout file named `activity_about.xml` with the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/about_text"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="16sp" />

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/about_statistics"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="16sp" />

</LinearLayout>
```
**Step 3: Initialize the Activity**

* Initialize the activity in the `onCreate` method by calling `setContentView(R.layout.activity_about)` to set the layout for the activity.

**Step 4: Load Statistics**

* Call the `loadStatistics` method to retrieve statistics from the Sensable service and update the statistics text view.

**Step 5: Handle Callbacks**

* Implement the `success` and `failure` callback methods to handle the response from the Sensable service.

**Step 6: Display Statistics**

* Display the statistics in the activity's layout by setting the text of the `statistics` text view to the formatted statistics string.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import io.sensable.client.AboutActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        AboutActivity aboutActivity = new AboutActivity();
        aboutActivity.loadStatistics();
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the AboutActivity class in your Android project.

**Note:** Make sure to replace the `activity_about.xml` layout file with your own layout file, and update the `R.id.about_text` and `R.id.about_statistics` references accordingly.
