## description


A broadcast receiver that handles system boot events and starts an AlarmManager to schedule tasks using the ScheduleHelper class.

## code_explanation


This Java class extends the `BroadcastReceiver` class and overrides the `onReceive` method to handle system boot events. When the device boots, the receiver starts an AlarmManager to schedule tasks using the ScheduleHelper class. The `onReceive` method is the entry point for the receiver, where it receives the Intent object that triggered the event. It then creates a new instance of the ScheduleHelper class and calls the `startScheduler` method to initiate the scheduling process.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `android.content.BroadcastReceiver`: A built-in Android class that allows the application to receive broadcast messages from the system or other applications.
*   `android.content.Context`: A built-in Android class that provides access to resources and APIs needed to perform functions within the application.
*   `android.content.Intent`: A built-in Android class that represents a message that can be sent between components of the application or system.

### Third-party Libraries

*   `None`: No third-party libraries are used in this code snippet.

### Custom Libraries

*   `ScheduleHelper`: A custom class that is used to schedule tasks. Its implementation is not provided in this code snippet.

## additional_information


*   The `onReceive` method is called when the device boots, and it starts the AlarmManager to schedule tasks.
*   The `ScheduleHelper` class is responsible for initiating the scheduling process.
*   The `startScheduler` method is called to initiate the scheduling process.
*   The `TAG` variable is used as a logging tag to identify the source of log messages.
*   The `Log.d` method is used to log debug messages to the system log.
## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for BootReceiver Class**

### Using the BootReceiver Class

**Overview:**
The BootReceiver class is a broadcast receiver that handles events related to the system booting up. It starts an AlarmManager to schedule tasks using the ScheduleHelper class.

**Step 1: Create a ScheduleHelper Instance**

* Create a new instance of the ScheduleHelper class to handle the scheduling of tasks. The ScheduleHelper class is not provided in the given code, but it is assumed to be a separate class responsible for scheduling tasks.

**Step 2: Register the BootReceiver**

* Register the BootReceiver class in the AndroidManifest.xml file to receive broadcast intents when the device boots.

```xml
<receiver android:name=".BootReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

**Step 3: Implement the onReceive Method**

* Implement the onReceive method in the BootReceiver class to handle the broadcast intent when the device boots. This method should start the AlarmManager and initiate the ScheduleHelper to begin scheduling tasks.

**Step 4: Start the AlarmManager**

* Start the AlarmManager to schedule tasks using the ScheduleHelper class.

**Step 5: Test the BootReceiver**

* Test the BootReceiver class by booting the device and verifying that the AlarmManager starts and the ScheduleHelper begins scheduling tasks.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;

public class BootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        Log.d("BootReceiver", "Starting AlarmManager at Boot (onReceive)");
        ScheduleHelper scheduleHelper = new ScheduleHelper(context);
        scheduleHelper.startScheduler();
    }
}
```

**Note:**

* The ScheduleHelper class is not provided in the given code and should be implemented separately to handle the scheduling of tasks.
* The BootReceiver class should be registered in the AndroidManifest.xml file to receive broadcast intents when the device boots.
* The onReceive method should be implemented to handle the broadcast intent and start the AlarmManager to schedule tasks using the ScheduleHelper class.
