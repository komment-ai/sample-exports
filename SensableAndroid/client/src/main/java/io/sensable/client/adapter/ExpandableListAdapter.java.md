## description


A custom adapter for Android's ExpandableListView, providing functionality for displaying data in an expandable list format. It takes in a context, a list of header titles, and a map of child data in the format of header title, child title.

## code_explanation


This adapter extends BaseExpandableListAdapter and provides methods for getting child and group objects, as well as inflating views for each item in the list. The adapter uses a HashMap to store the child data, where each key is a header title and the value is a list of child titles. The adapter also uses the LayoutInflater to inflate the list item and group layouts.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for ExpandableListAdapter**

### Using the ExpandableListAdapter

**Overview:**
The ExpandableListAdapter is a customizable adapter that extends BaseExpandableListAdapter and provides functionality for displaying data in an expandable list format.

**Step 1: Create a List of Header Titles**

* Create a list of header titles that will be used to display the groups in the expandable list. This list should contain strings that will be used as the titles of the groups.

**Step 2: Create a Map of Child Data**

* Create a map of child data that will be used to display the child elements within each group. The map should have the header titles as keys and lists of child titles as values.

**Step 3: Create an Instance of the ExpandableListAdapter**

* Create an instance of the ExpandableListAdapter and pass in the context, list of header titles, and map of child data.

**Step 4: Use the Adapter to Display the Data**

* Use the ExpandableListAdapter to display the data in an expandable list format. You can do this by creating a ListView and passing the adapter to it.

**Step 5: Configure the Adapter**

* Configure the adapter by overriding the necessary methods to customize its behavior. For example, you can override the getChildView method to customize the appearance of the child elements.

**Potential Pitfalls:**

* Make sure to handle the case where the convertView is null, as this can cause the adapter to inflate a new view every time it is called.
* Make sure to handle the case where the childPosition is out of bounds, as this can cause the adapter to throw an exception.

**Example Usage:**

```java
// Create a list of header titles
List<String> headerTitles = new ArrayList<>();
headerTitles.add("Group 1");
headerTitles.add("Group 2");
headerTitles.add("Group 3");

// Create a map of child data
HashMap<String, List<String>> childData = new HashMap<>();
List<String> group1Children = new ArrayList<>();
group1Children.add("Child 1");
group1Children.add("Child 2");
group1Children.add("Child 3");
childData.put(headerTitles.get(0), group1Children);

List<String> group2Children = new ArrayList<>();
group2Children.add("Child 4");
group2Children.add("Child 5");
group2Children.add("Child 6");
childData.put(headerTitles.get(1), group2Children);

List<String> group3Children = new ArrayList<>();
group3Children.add("Child 7");
group3Children.add("Child 8");
group3Children.add("Child 9");
childData.put(headerTitles.get(2), group3Children);

// Create an instance of the ExpandableListAdapter
ExpandableListAdapter adapter = new ExpandableListAdapter(this, headerTitles, childData);

// Use the adapter to display the data
ListView listView = findViewById(R.id.list_view);
listView.setAdapter(adapter);
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the ExpandableListAdapter to display data in an expandable list format.
