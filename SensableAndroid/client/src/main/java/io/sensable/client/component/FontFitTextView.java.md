## description


A custom `TextView` class that automatically adjusts the font size to fit the text within a specified width.

## code_explanation


The `FontFitTextView` class extends the `TextView` class in Android and includes methods to resize the font based on the available width. The `refitText` method is used to adjust the text size to fit within the specified width. This method uses a binary search approach to find the optimal text size that fits within the available space.

The class also overrides several methods from the `TextView` class to recalculate the text dimensions when the width or height changes. These methods include `onMeasure`, `onTextChanged`, and `onSizeChanged`, which are used to update the text size based on the new width and height of the view.

* Set the width of the FontFitTextView instance using the `setWidth()` method or by setting the width in the layout XML file.

**Step 4: Adjust Font Size**

* The FontFitTextView class will automatically adjust the font size to fit the text within the specified width. You do not need to manually adjust the font size.

**Step 5: Handle Text Changes**

* The FontFitTextView class will automatically recalculate the text dimensions when the text changes. You do not need to manually handle text changes.

**Step 6: Handle View Size Changes**

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        FontFitTextView textView = new FontFitTextView(this);
        textView.setText("This is a sample text that needs to be resized to fit within the available width.");
        textView.setWidth(200);
        setContentView(textView);
