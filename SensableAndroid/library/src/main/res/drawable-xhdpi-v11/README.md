## Description

A directory containing drawable resources for the project, specifically designed for xhdpi (Extra High Density) screens and Android API version 11 and above.


## Contents

The directory contains a single PNG image file, `ic_stat_rocket.png`, which is used as a status bar icon for the application.


## Usage

This directory is used by the Android system to load the correct drawable resource based on the device's screen density and API version. The image file is referenced in the application's code and is displayed in the status bar when the application is running.


## Relationship to Other Directories

This directory is part of the `library/src/main/res` directory, which contains all the resource files for the library module. The `drawable-xhdpi-v11` directory is one of several directories that provide different versions of the same image file for different screen densities and API versions.
