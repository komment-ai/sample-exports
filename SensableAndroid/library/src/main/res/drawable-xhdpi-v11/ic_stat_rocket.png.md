## Description

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is a drawable resource used in the project to display a rocket icon. It is part of the `library` module and is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi-v11` folder, indicating that it is optimized for extra high density screens (xhdpi) and Android version 11 (v11). The file is likely used as a status bar icon or a notification icon in the application.



## Implementation details

The file is a PNG image that contains the rocket icon. It is not a code file, so there are no functions or methods to describe. However, it is worth noting that the file is part of a set of similar icons with different densities (hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi) and versions (v11), which allows the application to display the correct icon depending on the device's screen density and Android version.
