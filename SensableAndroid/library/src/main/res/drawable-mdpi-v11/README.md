## Description


A directory containing medium-density pixel (MDPI) image resources for the project, specifically designed for Android devices with medium-density screens. The directory is part of the `library` module and contains image assets that are used by the application.


## Contents


The directory contains the following image resources:

* `ic_stat_rocket.png`: a status bar icon for the application, optimized for MDPI screens.


## Usage


These image resources are used by the application to display visual elements on medium-density screens. The Android system automatically selects the correct image resource based on the device's screen density.


## Notes


* The `v11` suffix in the directory name indicates that these resources are optimized for Android API level 11 (Honeycomb) and later.
* The MDPI density bucket corresponds to screens with a density of 160 pixels per inch (PPI).
