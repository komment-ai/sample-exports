## Description


The file `./library/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi-v11/ic_stat_rocket.png` is a high-resolution icon image used in the project. It is a PNG file designed for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens, specifically for Android API level 11 and above. The image is likely used as a status bar icon for the application.


## Implementation details


This file is part of the project's resources, specifically in the `drawable-xxhdpi-v11` folder, which contains images optimized for xxhdpi screens on Android API level 11 and above. The file is used by the Android system to display the application's icon in the status bar.

As a PNG file, it contains compressed bitmap data that is decoded and rendered by the Android system. The image is likely a small icon, possibly with a transparent background, that represents the application's brand or identity.

The file is not a code file, so there are no functions, methods, or classes to describe. Its purpose is solely to provide a visual representation of the application's icon on xxhdpi screens.
