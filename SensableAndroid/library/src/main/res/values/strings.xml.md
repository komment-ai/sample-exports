## Description

The `strings.xml` file is a resource file used in Android development to store string constants. It is part of the `library` module in the SensableAndroid project. This file defines a set of string values that can be used throughout the application, allowing for easy maintenance and modification of text content.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Accessing string resources**\n To use the string resources defined in this file, you can access them using the `R.string` class in your Java code. For example, `R.string.app_name` would refer to the string resource with the name "app_name".
* **Step 2: Modifying string values**\n To change the value of a string resource, simply modify the corresponding string element in the `strings.xml` file. The changes will be reflected throughout the application.
* **Step 3: Adding new string resources**\n To add a new string resource, create a new `string` element in the `strings.xml` file and assign it a unique name.


## Implementation details


The `strings.xml` file contains a list of string elements, each with a unique name and value. The file is parsed by the Android build system and generates a corresponding Java class (`R.string`) that allows access to the string resources.

* `<string name="app_name">Android Gradle</string>`: Defines a string resource with the name "app_name" and the value "Android Gradle".
