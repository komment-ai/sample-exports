## Description

A directory containing values for the Android project, specifically for the library module. The contents of this directory define various values that are used throughout the library, such as strings, colors, and dimensions.


## Contents

The directory currently contains a single file, `strings.xml`, which defines a set of strings that can be used within the library.


## Usage

These values can be accessed within the library's code using the `R.values` class. For example, to access a string defined in `strings.xml`, you would use `R.values.string_name`.


## Security Aspects

None of the values defined in this directory pose a security risk, as they are simply static values used for display or configuration purposes.


## Dependencies

This directory does not depend on any other directories or modules within the project.
