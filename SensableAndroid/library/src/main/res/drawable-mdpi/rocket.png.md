## Description

The file `./library/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/rocket.png` is a medium-density (mdpi) image of a rocket, used as a graphical resource in the SensableAndroid project. It is part of the library module's resources and is likely used in various components of the application, such as icons, logos, or other visual elements.


## Implementation details

This image is a raster graphics file in PNG format, optimized for medium-density displays. The image is probably used in conjunction with other density-specific versions of the same image (e.g., ldpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi) to provide a consistent visual experience across different screen densities and resolutions.

As a graphical resource, this file does not contain any executable code or complex logic. Its purpose is to provide a visual representation of a rocket, which can be used in various contexts within the application.


## Usage instructions

This file is not intended to be used directly by developers. Instead, it is a resource that is referenced and used by the application's code. However, here are some general steps for using this image in an Android application:

* **Step 1: Add the image to the project**\n Place the `rocket.png` file in the `res/drawable-mdpi` directory of the Android project.
* **Step 2: Reference the image in layout files**\n Use the `@drawable/rocket` syntax to reference the image in layout files (e.g., `activity_main.xml`).
* **Step 3: Use the image in code**\n Load the image programmatically using the `getDrawable()` method or `Resources.getDrawable()` method.

Note that these steps are general guidelines and may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project.
