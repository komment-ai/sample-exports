## Description

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is a medium-density pixel (mdpi) image used as a status bar icon in the Android application. It is part of the `library` module and is located in the `drawable-mdpi` folder.


## Implementation details

This image is used to represent the application in the status bar of devices with medium-density screens. The image is a rocket icon, which is likely used to symbolize the application's purpose or brand.

Note that there are multiple versions of this image in different densities (e.g., `drawable-hdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, `drawable-xxhdpi`) to support various screen resolutions.
