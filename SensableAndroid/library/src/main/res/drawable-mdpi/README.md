## Description

A directory containing medium-density (MDPI) image assets for the project.


## Contents

The directory contains the following image assets:
* rocket.png
* ic_stat_rocket.png

These images are used in the project to provide visual representations of various elements.


## Usage

The images in this directory are used by the Android operating system to display icons and other visual elements at medium density. The MDPI density is typically used for medium-resolution screens, such as those found on older Android devices.


## Density-Specific Directories

The project uses density-specific directories to store image assets at different resolutions. This allows the Android operating system to select the most suitable image for the device's screen density. The density-specific directories in the project include:
* drawable-mdpi (medium-density)
* drawable-hdpi (high-density)
* drawable-xhdpi (extra-high-density)
* drawable-xxhdpi (extra-extra-high-density)
