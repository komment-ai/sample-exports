## Description

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is an image resource used in the project, specifically designed for xxhdpi (extra-extra-high-density) displays. It is part of the `library` module and is located in the `drawable-xxhdpi` directory. This image is likely used as an icon or graphic element within the application.


## Implementation details

The `ic_stat_rocket.png` file is a static image asset that is bundled with the application. It is not a code file and does not contain any executable logic. However, it is used by the application to display a visual representation of a rocket, which may be used as an icon, logo, or other graphical element.

As this is a static image file, there are no functions, methods, or classes to describe. The image is simply a resource that is used by the application to enhance its visual appearance.


## Usage instructions

Since this is a static image file, there are no specific usage instructions. The image is used by the application automatically, and its display is controlled by the application's layout and design.

However, if you need to use this image in your own code, you can access it using the `R.drawable.ic_stat_rocket` resource ID in your Java code or `@drawable/ic_stat_rocket` in your XML layouts.


## Additional notes

This image is part of a set of images with different densities (hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, etc.) to ensure that the application displays correctly on devices with different screen resolutions.
