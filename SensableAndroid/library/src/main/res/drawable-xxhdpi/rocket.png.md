## Description

The `rocket.png` file is a graphics resource used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a PNG image file that contains a visual representation of a rocket. The file is stored in the `drawable-xxhdpi` folder, which suggests that it is intended for use on devices with extra-extra-high density displays.


## Implementation details

The `rocket.png` file is likely used as an icon or visual element in the project's user interface. The image is probably displayed in various parts of the application, such as in the app's launcher icon, in the navigation menu, or as a decorative element on certain screens.

The file is stored in a folder that is specific to extra-extra-high density displays, which means that it will be used on devices with very high-resolution screens. This suggests that the image is designed to be visually appealing and detailed, and that it may be used in a prominent location in the application.

There are no specific functions, methods, or classes associated with this file, as it is a graphics resource rather than a code file. However, the file may be referenced in the project's layout files or in Java code that handles the display of visual elements.


## Usage instructions

This file does not require any specific usage instructions, as it is a graphics resource that is used by the application's code. However, developers who want to use this image in their own code can follow these general steps:

*   **Step 1: Copy the image file**
    Copy the `rocket.png` file from the `drawable-xxhdpi` folder into your own project's resources folder.
*   **Step 2: Reference the image in your code**
    Use the image in your Java code or layout files by referencing its name and location. For example, you might use the `R.drawable.rocket` syntax to reference the image in your Java code.
*   **Step 3: Display the image**
    Use the image in your application's user interface by displaying it in an `ImageView` or other visual element.
