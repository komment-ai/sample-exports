## Description

A directory containing high-density (xxhdpi) image assets for the library project. This directory is part of the Android project structure and contains images that are used in the application.


## Contents

The directory contains the following images:
* rocket.png
* ic_stat_rocket.png

These images are used in the library project and are scaled for xxhdpi screen density. The xxhdpi density is used for devices with extra-extra-high-density screens, typically with a pixel density of around 480 dpi.


## Usage

The images in this directory are used in the application's layouts and can be referenced in XML files using the `@drawable` notation. For example, to reference the `rocket.png` image, you would use `@drawable/rocket`.


## Best Practices

To ensure that the images are used correctly, it's recommended to follow these best practices:
* Use the correct density-specific directory for each image.
* Use the `@drawable` notation to reference images in XML files.
* Avoid hardcoding image sizes or densities in the application code.
