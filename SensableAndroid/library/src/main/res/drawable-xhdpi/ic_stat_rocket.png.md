## Description

The file `./library/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_stat_rocket.png` is a status bar icon image used in the project. It is a graphical representation of a rocket and is used to visually identify the application in the status bar of an Android device.


## Implementation details

This file is a PNG image and is stored in the `drawable-xhdpi` directory, which means it is designed for extra-high density displays. The image is used by the Android operating system to display the application's icon in the status bar.

There are no code-level implementation details to discuss, as this is a graphical asset rather than a code file.
