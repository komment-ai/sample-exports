## Description

A directory containing high-density (hdpi) image assets for Android API level 11 and above. This directory is part of the library module in the SensableAndroid project.


## Contents

This directory contains a single image file, `ic_stat_rocket.png`, which is a high-density icon for API level 11 and above.


## Purpose

The image assets in this directory are used to provide icons for the application on high-density devices running Android API level 11 and above.


## Usage

The image assets in this directory are used by the Android system to display icons for the application. They are referenced in the application's code using the `@drawable` notation.


## Relationship to Other Directories

This directory is part of the `res` directory hierarchy in the library module, which contains resources for the application. The `res` directory is further divided into subdirectories based on the type of resource (e.g., `drawable`, `layout`, `values`) and the screen density (e.g., `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, `xxhdpi`) and API level (e.g., `v11`).
