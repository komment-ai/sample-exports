## Description

The file `./library/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_stat_rocket.png` is a high-density pixel (hdpi) image file used in the Sensable Android project. It is a variant of the `ic_stat_rocket.png` image, which is used to represent a rocket icon in the application. The image is designed for high-density pixel displays and is used to provide a visually appealing and high-quality icon for the application.


## Implementation details

The image file is a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, which is a common format for graphics and icons in Android applications. The file is stored in the `drawable-hdpi` directory, which indicates that it is designed for high-density pixel displays. The image is used in conjunction with other variants of the `ic_stat_rocket.png` image, which are stored in different directories (e.g., `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, etc.) to provide a consistent and high-quality icon across different screen densities.


## Usage instructions

Since this is an image file, there are no specific usage instructions. However, developers can use this image in their Android application by referencing it in their code or layout files. For example, they can use the `android:drawable` attribute in a layout file to set the image as the icon for a button or other view.
