## Description

The `./library/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file is a crucial configuration file in the Android project. It provides essential information about the library module to the Android build tools and the Android operating system. The file is used to declare the library's metadata, such as its package name, version code, and version name, as well as its dependencies and permissions.


## Usage instructions


* **Step 1: Declare the library's metadata**\n The library's metadata, such as its package name, version code, and version name, must be declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This information is used to identify the library and its version.
* **Step 2: Specify the library's dependencies**\n The library's dependencies, such as other libraries or Android SDKs, must be specified in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This information is used to ensure that the library is built and deployed correctly.
* **Step 3: Declare the library's permissions**\n The library's permissions, such as access to the internet or device hardware, must be declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This information is used to ensure that the library has the necessary permissions to function correctly.


## Implementation details


The `AndroidManifest.xml` file is an XML file that contains a single `manifest` element, which is the root element of the file. The `manifest` element contains several child elements, including:

* `package`: specifies the library's package name.
* `versionCode`: specifies the library's version code.
* `versionName`: specifies the library's version name.
* `uses-sdk`: specifies the Android SDK version that the library is compatible with.
* `uses-permission`: specifies the permissions that the library requires.

In this specific implementation, the `AndroidManifest.xml` file declares the library's metadata, including its package name, version code, and version name. It also specifies the Android SDK version that the library is compatible with and declares the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission, which allows the library to access the internet.
