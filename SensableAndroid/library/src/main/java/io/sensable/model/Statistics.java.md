## description


A simple Java class that represents a count value and provides methods for accessing and modifying that value.

## code_explanation


The `Statistics` class is designed to hold a single integer value, `count`, which represents the number of elements in a collection. The class has a private variable `count` and three public methods: `getCount()`, `setCount()`, and `getCount()`. The `getCount()` method returns the current value of the `count` variable, the `setCount()` method allows it to be set to a new value, and the `getCount()` method does not allow it to be modified in any other way.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `java.lang`: The `Statistics` class uses built-in Java libraries for basic data types and functionality.

### Third-party Libraries

*   `None`: No third-party libraries are used in this code snippet.

### Custom Libraries

*   `None`: No custom libraries are used in this code snippet.

## additional_information


*   The `Statistics` class is designed to be thread-safe, as the `count` variable is private and can only be modified through the `setCount()` method.
*   The class can be extended to include additional functionality, such as methods for incrementing or decrementing the `count` variable.
*   The class can also be used as a building block for more complex data structures, such as a statistics collection class.
## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for Statistics Class**

### Using the Statistics Class

**Overview:**
The Statistics class is a simple Java class that represents a count value and provides methods for accessing and modifying that value.

**Step 1: Import the Class**

* Import the Statistics class into your Java application using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.model.Statistics;`

**Step 2: Create an Instance of the Class**

* Create an instance of the Statistics class using the default constructor: `Statistics stats = new Statistics();`

**Step 3: Get the Current Count Value**

* Use the `getCount()` method to retrieve the current count value: `int currentCount = stats.getCount();`

**Step 4: Set a New Count Value**

* Use the `setCount()` method to set a new count value: `stats.setCount(10);`

**Step 5: Retrieve the Updated Count Value**

* Use the `getCount()` method to retrieve the updated count value: `int updatedCount = stats.getCount();`

**Important Notes:**

* The `count` field is private, so it can only be accessed through the `getCount()` and `setCount()` methods.
* The `setCount()` method allows the count value to be set to any integer value.
* The `getCount()` method returns the current value of the `count` field.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import io.sensable.model.Statistics;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Statistics stats = new Statistics();
        System.out.println("Initial count: " + stats.getCount()); // prints 0

        stats.setCount(10);
        System.out.println("Updated count: " + stats.getCount()); // prints 10

        stats.setCount(20);
        System.out.println("Final count: " + stats.getCount()); // prints 20
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the Statistics class in your Java application.
