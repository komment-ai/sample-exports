## description


A Java class named `SampleResponse` that contains attributes for a message and a sensor ID. It provides getter and setter methods for these attributes.

## code_explanation


The `SampleResponse` class is designed to encapsulate data related to a sample response. It has two private attributes: `message` and `sensorid`, which are used to store the message and sensor ID, respectively. The class includes getter and setter methods for these attributes, allowing for easy access and modification of their values.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `java.lang`: The `String` class used in the attributes and method parameters.

### Third-party Libraries

*   `None`: No third-party libraries are used in this code snippet.

### Custom Libraries

*   `None`: No custom libraries are used in this code snippet.



## security_insights


No security insights are available for this file. However, it is essential to note that the class does not include any validation or sanitization of the input data, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

## additional_information


*   The class can be extended to include more attributes or methods as needed.
*   Consider adding validation or sanitization to the setter methods to ensure the integrity of the data.
*   The class can be used as a simple data transfer object (DTO) to pass data between layers of an application.

**Usage Instructions for SampleResponse Class**

### Using the SampleResponse Class

**Overview:**
The SampleResponse class is a simple Java class that represents a response from a sensor. It has two attributes: message and sensorid, and provides methods to set and retrieve their values.

**Step 1: Import the Class**

* Import the SampleResponse class into your Java project using the following line of code: `import io.sensable.model.SampleResponse;`

**Step 2: Create an Instance of the Class**

* Create an instance of the SampleResponse class by calling its constructor: `SampleResponse response = new SampleResponse();`

**Step 3: Set the Message Attribute**

* Use the setMessage method to set the value of the message attribute: `response.setMessage("Hello, World!");`

**Step 4: Set the Sensor ID Attribute**

* Use the setSensorid method to set the value of the sensorid attribute: `response.setSensorid("S12345");`

**Step 5: Get the Message Attribute**

* Use the getMessage method to retrieve the value of the message attribute: `String message = response.getMessage();`

**Step 6: Get the Sensor ID Attribute**

* Use the getSensorid method to retrieve the value of the sensorid attribute: `String sensorId = response.getSensorid();`

**Example Usage:**

```java
import io.sensable.model.SampleResponse;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SampleResponse response = new SampleResponse();
        response.setMessage("Hello, World!");
        response.setSensorid("S12345");

        System.out.println("Message: " + response.getMessage());
        System.out.println("Sensor ID: " + response.getSensorid());
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the SampleResponse class in your Java project.
