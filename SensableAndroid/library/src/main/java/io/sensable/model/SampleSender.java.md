## description


A Java class representing a sender of samples. It provides getter and setter methods for access token and sample.

## code_explanation


The `SampleSender` class is designed to hold and manage two key pieces of data: an access token and a sample. It follows standard Java object-oriented programming principles, encapsulating data within its private fields and providing controlled access through public getter and setter methods.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `java.lang`: The standard Java library is used for basic data types and functionality.

### Third-party Libraries

*   `None`: No third-party libraries are used in this code snippet.

### Custom Libraries

*   `io.sensable.model.Sample`: This is a custom class defined within the same package, representing a sample of data. It is used as a field within the `SampleSender` class.

## additional_information


*   The `SampleSender` class is designed to be a simple container for an access token and a sample. It does not perform any complex operations or validation on its data.
*   The use of public getter and setter methods allows for flexibility in accessing and modifying the class's fields, but also increases the risk of unintended data modifications if not used carefully.
*   The relationship between `SampleSender` and `Sample` is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is likely that `Sample` is a custom class designed to hold specific data or metadata.
*   The `SampleSender` class could be extended to include additional features, such as data validation or encryption, depending on its intended use case.
## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for SampleSender Class**

### Using the SampleSender Class

**Overview:**
The SampleSender class is a Java class that represents a sender of samples. It provides methods to set and retrieve the access token and sample.

**Step 1: Create an Instance of the SampleSender Class**

* Create a new instance of the SampleSender class using the following code: `SampleSender sender = new SampleSender();`

**Step 2: Set the Access Token**

* Set the access token using the `setAccessToken` method, passing a string value as an argument: `sender.setAccessToken("your_access_token");`

**Step 3: Set the Sample**

* Set the sample using the `setSample` method, passing a Sample object as an argument: `Sample sample = new Sample(); sender.setSample(sample);`

**Step 4: Get the Access Token**

* Get the access token using the `getAccessToken` method, which returns a string value: `String accessToken = sender.getAccessToken();`

**Step 5: Get the Sample**

* Get the sample using the `getSample` method, which returns a Sample object: `Sample sample = sender.getSample();`

**Step 6: Use the Sample Sender**

* Use the SampleSender class to send samples by calling the methods to set and retrieve the access token and sample.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import io.sensable.model.Sample;
import io.sensable.model.SampleSender;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new instance of the SampleSender class
        SampleSender sender = new SampleSender();

        // Set the access token
        sender.setAccessToken("your_access_token");

        // Set the sample
        Sample sample = new Sample();
        sender.setSample(sample);

        // Get the access token
        String accessToken = sender.getAccessToken();
        System.out.println("Access Token: " + accessToken);

        // Get the sample
        Sample retrievedSample = sender.getSample();
        System.out.println("Sample: " + retrievedSample);
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the SampleSender class in your Java application.

Note: The Sample class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase, and its implementation is not provided here.
