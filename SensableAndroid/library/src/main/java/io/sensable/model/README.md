## Description

A directory containing Java classes that represent data models used in the Sensable Android project. These models are used to store and manage data related to users, sensables, samples, and statistics.


## Models

The directory contains the following data models:

* `UserLogin.java`: Represents a user's login credentials.
* `Sample.java`: Represents a sample data point collected by a sensable.
* `User.java`: Represents a user's information.
* `SampleSender.java`: Represents a sample sender's information.
* `Sensable.java`: Represents a sensable's information.
* `Statistics.java`: Represents statistics related to sensables.
* `ScheduledSensable.java`: Represents a scheduled sensable's information.
* `SampleResponse.java`: Represents a response to a sample data point.

These models are used throughout the project to store and manage data, and are likely used in conjunction with other components, such as the `SensableService.java` class, to provide functionality to the application.
