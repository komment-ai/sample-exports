## description


A Java class that represents a sensory data point with various metadata such as location, sensor ID, name, type, and unit. The class also contains a sample value, which can be retrieved through the `getSample()` method or set through the `setSample()` method. Additionally, the class has a `writeToParcel()` method for serializing the data to a Parcel object.

## code_explanation


The `Sensable` class is a Parcelable object that represents a sensory data point. It contains properties for location, sensor ID, name, sensor type, samples, unit, and access token. The class has methods for getting and setting these properties, as well as a `toString()` method for generating a string representation of the object. The `writeToParcel()` method is used for serializing the data to a Parcel object, and the `createFromParcel()` and `newArray()` methods are used for deserializing the data from a Parcel object.

## additional_information


*   The `Sensable` class can be extended to include more features, such as additional properties or methods for working with the sample data.
*   The `Sample` class can be modified to include more properties or methods for working with the sample data.
*   The `writeToParcel()` method can be modified to include more data or use different serialization techniques.

### Sample Class

The `Sample` class is a custom library that represents a sample object. It has properties for sample name, description, and value, as well as a `toJson()` method for generating a JSON representation of the object.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for Sensable Class**

### Using the Sensable Class

**Overview:**
The Sensable class is a Java class that represents a sensory data point with various metadata such as location, sensor ID, name, type, and unit. The class also contains a sample value, which can be retrieved through the `getSample()` method or set through the `setSample()` method.

**Step 1: Create an Instance of the Sensable Class**

* Create a new instance of the Sensable class using the default constructor: `Sensable sensable = new Sensable();`

**Step 2: Set the Sensor ID**

* Set the sensor ID using the `setSensorid()` method: `sensable.setSensorid("sensor-123");`

**Step 3: Set the Location**

* Set the location using the `setLocation()` method: `sensable.setLocation(new double[] { 12.345, 67.890 });`

**Step 4: Set the Sample**

* Set the sample using the `setSample()` method: `sensable.setSample(new Sample("sample-1", "description-1"));`

**Step 5: Get the Sample as a JSON String**

* Get the sample as a JSON string using the `getSampleAsJsonString()` method: `String json = sensable.getSampleAsJsonString();`

**Step 6: Write the Sensable Object to a Parcel**

* Write the Sensable object to a Parcel object using the `writeToParcel()` method: `Parcel parcel = Parcel.obtain(); sensable.writeToParcel(parcel, 0);`

**Example Usage:**

```java
import android.os.Parcel;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sensable sensable = new Sensable();
        sensable.setSensorid("sensor-123");
        sensable.setLocation(new double[] { 12.345, 67.890 });
        sensable.setSample(new Sample("sample-1", "description-1"));
        String json = sensable.getSampleAsJsonString();
        Parcel parcel = Parcel.obtain();
        sensable.writeToParcel(parcel, 0);
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can successfully use the Sensable class in your Java application.

Note: The `Sample` class is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is assumed to have a `toJson()` method that returns a JSON representation of the sample object.
