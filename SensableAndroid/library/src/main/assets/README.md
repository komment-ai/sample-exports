## Description

A directory containing asset files for the library module of the project.


## Contents

The directory contains four asset files:

* `rocket-rainbow.png`
* `rocket-rainbow.jpg`
* `rocket-png.png`
* `rocket-jpg.jpg`

These files are likely used as images or icons within the library module.


## Usage

The asset files can be accessed and used within the library module's code. The exact usage depends on the specific requirements of the module, but they can be used in layouts, views, or other components.


## Notes

The asset files are not specific to any particular Android density or screen size, as they are not located in a density-specific directory (e.g., `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`, etc.). This means they will be used as-is, without any density scaling, on all devices.
