## Description

The `rocket-png.png` file is an image asset used in the SensableAndroid project. It is a PNG image of a rocket, which is likely used as a visual element in the application's user interface. The image is stored in the `assets` directory of the `library` module, which suggests that it is a shared resource used across multiple parts of the application.



## Implementation details

The image is a static asset and does not contain any executable code. It is likely referenced in the application's layout files or Java code using its file path and name. The image is used to provide a visual representation of a rocket, which may be used to represent a concept or idea within the application.
