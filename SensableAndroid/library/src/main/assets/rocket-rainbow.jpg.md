## Description

The `rocket-rainbow.jpg` file is an image asset used in the project. It is a JPEG image file located in the `library/src/main/assets` directory. The image is likely used as a visual element in the application, possibly as a logo, icon, or background image.



## Implementation details

The `rocket-rainbow.jpg` file is a static image asset, and as such, it does not contain any code or logic. It is simply a binary file that is used by the application to display a visual element.
