## description


A batch script for running the Gradle wrapper on Windows systems. It sets up the environment, finds the Java executable, and executes the Gradle wrapper.

## code_explanation


This script is designed to work with the Gradle wrapper, which is a tool that allows you to run Gradle builds on systems that don't have Gradle installed. The script sets up the environment by finding the Java executable, setting the classpath, and executing the Gradle wrapper.

The script uses a combination of conditional statements and variables to determine the location of the Java executable and the Gradle wrapper. It also handles different command-line argument formats depending on the Windows version being used.

## dependencies


### Built-in Libraries

*   `cmd.exe`: The Windows command-line interpreter.
*   `setlocal`: A command that sets the local scope for variables.
*   `if`: A command that performs conditional testing.
*   `goto`: A command that transfers control to a labeled line.
*   `echo`: A command that displays messages to the console.
*   `exit`: A command that exits the script.

### Third-party Libraries

*   `Gradle Wrapper`: A tool that allows you to run Gradle builds on systems that don't have Gradle installed.

### Custom Libraries

*   `None`: No custom libraries are used in this script.

## usage_instructions

**Usage Instructions for gradlew.bat**

### Using the gradlew.bat Script

**Overview:**
The gradlew.bat script is a Gradle startup script for Windows that allows you to build and manage your Gradle projects.

**Step 1: Set the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable**

* Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your Java installation. This is necessary for the script to find the Java executable.

**Step 2: Update the Script**

* Open the gradlew.bat script in a text editor and update the DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS variable to include any additional JVM options you want to use.
* Save the changes to the script.

**Step 3: Run the Script**

* Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where the gradlew.bat script is located.
* Run the script by typing `gradlew.bat` and follow the prompts to build and manage your Gradle project.

**Step 4: Pass Command-Line Arguments**

* Pass command-line arguments to the script by typing `gradlew.bat <arguments>`, where `<arguments>` are the options you want to pass to the script.

**Step 5: Handle Errors**

* If the script encounters an error, it will display an error message and exit with a non-zero return code. You can use the `GRADLE_EXIT_CONSOLE` variable to capture the return code and handle the error accordingly.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
C:\path\to\project>gradlew.bat build
```

This will build your Gradle project using the default build configuration.

```bash
C:\path\to\project>gradlew.bat clean build
```

This will clean the project and then build it using the default build configuration.

```bash
C:\path\to\project>gradlew.bat -Dorg.gradle.daemon=true build
```

This will build the project using the Gradle daemon and the default build configuration.

By following these steps, you can successfully use the gradlew.bat script to build and manage your Gradle projects on Windows.

### Notes:

* Make sure to update the script to include any additional JVM options you want to use.
* You can pass command-line arguments to the script by typing `gradlew.bat <arguments>`.
* The script will display an error message and exit with a non-zero return code if it encounters an error.
* You can use the `GRADLE_EXIT_CONSOLE` variable to capture the return code and handle the error accordingly.
